<A HREF="screenshots/index.html">screenshots</A> !! Definitely
worth a look :-) There is now a demo how to use the
cool_buttonclass from his coolimages lib. XaoS depends on

Johan Alfredsson fixed a bug in C:SetKeyboard and RAM handler.
IPrefs can now use notification in ENV:Sys/ to update preferences.

Thanks to Stefan Berger, one can now abort packets sent to filesystems.
