Sebastian Bauer continued to work on our version of the MUI (based on Zune).
It compiles and a few classes actually do something useful.

Staf Verhaegen did implement the div() and ldiv() C functions.

Henning Kiel added a couple of stub functions in c.lib so makedepend
compiles on AROS. Makedepend is now part of the default build.
Also, he worked a bit on the GNU tools ports.

Georg Steger fixed a couple of bugs in the code which gets and puts
images (bitmaps) and closed a few holes in our version of MUI. He
fixed a deadlock in intuition, made scrolling with the arrow keys
in More useful (did scroll at insane speeds) and fixed a notification
issue in MultiView.

David Somerton fixed a bug in nasm and added a test-program to test if it
works. There is a now a script which generates the assembler bindings
for the AROS libraries.
