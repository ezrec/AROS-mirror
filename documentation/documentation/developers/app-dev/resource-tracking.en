Resource Tracking (RT)
----------------------

Everyone talks about RT but what's it anyway? RT means three things:

1. The OS takes notes about allocated resources (eg. memory, windows,
   libraries, devices, screens, etc).

2. The OS checks the usage of those resources (ie. Did you open
   that window you want to render into? Is it still open? Is that a
   window anyway?)

3. The OS closes resources if they are no longer used (either because your
   program crashed or because it exited without freeing them).

The current implementation can do all three things but to enable it,
you must make some modifications to your code. The only disadvantage of
the current implementation is that the resources won't be freed if the
program crashes.

1. Add the following lines to your code. It should be the first thing
   seen by the compiler::

       #define ENABLE_RT  1

   If you replace the 1 by 0, then RT will be silently disabled.

2. Add ``#include <aros/rt.h>`` after the last include from ``proto/``

3. Add ``RT_Init();`` as the first command in ``main()``.

4. Call ``RT_Exit()`` before you terminate your program.

5. Recompile.

The advantages are that you will get errors if you try to access resources
which you didn't allocate and that you will get a list of resources which you
didn't free at the end of your program. All messages will contain the position
in the code where the error happened (if available) and the position in the
code where the resource was allocated (this is the reason why RT has to be
compiled in. It could be built into the OS, too, but it would be hard to gather
the information where an error occurred).

A good example about how to use RT and what it can do can be found in
``AROS/workbench/demos/rtdemo.c``.

The following resources are tracked:

+ Memory in ``AllocMem()``, ``FreeMem()``,``AllocVec()`` and ``FreeVec()``

+ MsgPorts in ``CreateMsgPort()``, ``DeleteMsgPort()``, ``CreatePort()``,
  ``DeletePort()`` and ``PutMsg()``

+ Files in ``Open()``, ``Close()``, ``Read()`` and ``Write()``. ``Read()`` and
  ``Write()`` also check their buffers.

+ Windows in ``OpenWindow()``, ``OpenWindowTags()``, ``OpenWindowTagList()``,
  ``CloseWindow()``, ``WindowToFront()``, ``WindowToBack()``

+ Screens in ``OpenScreen()``, ``OpenScreenTags()``, ``OpenScreenTagList()``,
  ``CloseScreen()``, ``ScreenToFront()``, ``ScreenToBack()``. ``CloseScreen()``
  also checks for open windows on the screen before closing.
