Introduction

Developing for the AROS platform
================================

This chapter explains how to develop programs that will run on the AROS
platform.  It also tells you how to compile them on the different machines that
AROS runs on. It assumes that you have an average knowledge of the C language
and basic concepts like `linking`.


The "Hello, World!" program
----------------------------

Below is a program that shows a "Hello, World!" message - a programmer's
tradition since ages. The file `helloworld.c` has the following contents::

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    puts("Hello World");      
    return 0;
  }


Compiling in the AROS source tree with the build system
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have your own source tree of AROS and compiled AROS there, you can use the
AROS build system to compile programs for AROS. You do this by putting your
program source code somewhere in the AROS tree. The 'local' directory in main AROS
source directory can be used to put the code in. Let's first make a directory
there, assuming you are in the top AROS source directory::

  % mkdir local/helloworld

Put the helloworld.c file there and an additional file for the build
instructions named `mmakefile.src` with the following contents::

  include $(TOP)/config/make.cfg
  
  %build_prog mmake=local-helloworld files=helloworld progname=HelloWorld

In the top AROS source directory you can now build the helloworld program
with the following command::

  % make local-helloworld

You will find now in the binary tree of AROS the compiled program as
`local/helloworld/HelloWorld`.

The AROS build system is meant to ease your live when building binaries with
not-trivial dependencies. It is explained in a `separate chapter`__

__ buildsystem


Compiling on Linux with GCC
---------------------------

Under AROS/hosted you are using a configured version of the Linux GCC. 
There is a difference depending on whether you use the compiled version
of AROS (i386-linux-system) or you compile the source yourself:

+ i386-linux-system

  You have to download the package `i386-all-sdk`. Unpack it, cd into the
  created directory and start the script `AROS-SDK-Install`. Follow the instructions.

+ self-compiled

  The AROS compiler has the path `AROS/bin/linux-i386/tools`. Add this path to your
  Linux paths.
  
In both cases the name of the C compiler is i386-linux-aros-gcc. You have to
start it from the Linux side. You can compile the program with the following
command::

  % i386-linux-aros-gcc -o helloworld helloworld.c

You will find additional tools in the path of the AROS C compiler:
AROS versions of ld, ranlib, the catalog compiler Flexcat, etc.

.. Note:: If you are using i386-linux-aros-strip you have to add the parameters
   `--strip-unneeded --remove-section .comment`. Otherwise strip will create 
   corrupt binaries.


Compiling for native-i386
-------------------------

A native version of the compiler GCC is included.


Concepts
========

Include files
-------------

AROS comes with a variety of include files. They are placed in `sys:Development/include`.
The subdirectory `proto` contains include files with function prototypes for the
shared libraries. In `libraries` are headers with structures and defines.
Some of the bigger libraries like `Intuition` have their own directory
with headers.

AROS shared libraries
---------------------

Shared libraries are the magic that make AROS work. Every library is
a collection of functions that fulfil a certain purpose. Normally functions
with a similar purpose are contained in one library. For example all the basic
memory handling functions are contained in `exec.library`.

Libraries are normally found in the `LIBS:` directory, but can also be stored at
other places. Some important libraries are not stored as a separate file, but
are contained in the kernel. Note that this the kernel libraries are different
from installation to installation, so don't depend on a specific library being
part of the kernel.

AROS core libraries overview
............................

Here is a list of some important libraries and their function.
You don't have to remember all of these, as they will be discussed
later in detail.

+ `exec.library` is the most important library. It is responsible for handling
  the most basic things like managing `tasks` (i.e. programs), `memory`,
  `libraries` and many other  things.

+ `utility.library` implements very important mechanisms for "talking" to
  libraries: `taglists` that will be discussed later in this chapter and `hooks`.
  Apart from that, utility contains miscellaneous small utility functions.

+ `dos.library` is responsible for file-handling and some basic I/O functions.
  Without dos, AROS would not be able to access files.

+ `intuition.library` handles `graphical user interfaces (GUIs)`. With Intuition
  you can create `windows` and `gadgets` and handle them accordingly. There are
  other libraries, which work on top of intuition and provide more sophisticated
  and more specialised GUI functions. Examples are `gadtools.library`, which
  implements some more complicated gadgets and `asl.library`, which provides
  file- and other `requesters`.

FIXME: add zune, graphics, ...

How AROS libraries work
.......................

The term `library` usually refers to an object whose purpose is to collect in a
single place functions that programs may want to use more often than others,
and usually such functions all serve one common purpose, so that there can be
libraries to parse configuration files, to handle localization, and other kind
of tasks which a program might want to perform.

There are generally are 2 kinds of libraries: link-time libraries, and run-time
libraries. The link-time libraries, as the name suggests, are used only at
program linking stage: the linker collects all functions from the provided
libraries that are needed by the program and links them into one executable.
Run-time ones, instead, are made available to programs when they are run or
during their execution by special request of the program. In most systems the
run-time libraries are shared between running programs so they only take up
memory for one instance of the library. In such cases the object of 
often called a `shared library`.
Whilst link-time libraries are handled more or less the same way across all
operating systems, since they're independent from the OS itself, run-time
libraries may be handled differently by different OSs.

Before a library can be used in a program it has to be `opened`. This is
done by the exec function called ``OpenLibrary``. When a library is
successfully opened a pointer to the so called `library base` is return. The
library base is a zone of memory that both holds the function vectors and
the library's own data [#]_. When libraries are opened they are free to choose
whether it's base will be the same for all instances or that a new one will be
allocated each time. When a function of the library is called most of the
time the library base is passed to the function so the data in-there can be
used inside the library [#]_. A library can make part or whole of the data
in the library base public by defining a type for the base. If this is the
case you find the type in the include file `proto/libname.h`. Some older
libraries used this mechanism but more recent libraries don't make anything
public and the only way to change the internal state of the library is to
use the available functions.

.. [#] If you know C++, you might think of the vectors table as the `VTable`
       used for virtual methods, and the library base pointer as the `this`
       pointer.

.. [#] The passing of the library base may be explicit or implicit, depending
       on the convention used by the library. Also several mechanism may be
       used for the implicit passing of the base: C preprocessor macros,
       inline functions, global variables, ...

How to use AROS shared libraries
................................

As already explained in previous section libraries have to be opened before
it's functions may be used. The only library that doesn't have to be opened
first is `exec.library`. Exec is always open and your compiler
knows how to access it. Additionally you have to include a header to make the
prototype of the functions known to the code. This include file is in the
proto directory so if you want to use functions of `dos.library` you have to
use the following line::

  #include <proto/dos.h>

Your compiler or build environment may additionally open some libraries
for you, so you don't have to open them manually. Read
your compiler's manual to learn about such feature. In the coming paragraphs
the way it is done by the AROS tools and how to open libraries manually will
be explained.

Auto-opening by gcc from the AROS SDK
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The gcc compiler from the AROS SDK auto-opens the following core libraries:

- aros.library
- asl.library
- commodities.library
- cybergraphics.library
- datatypes.library
- diskfont.library
- dos.library
- expansion.library
- gadtools.library
- graphics.library
- icon.library
- iffparse.library
- intuition.library
- keymap.library
- layers.library
- locale.library
- muimaster.library (which is provided by Zune on AROS)
- partition.library
- realtime.library
- utility.library
- workbench.library

You can disable the auto-opening of these library by providing the
``-nostdlibs`` flag to the gcc compiler. For the other libraries provided by
AROS you can use the corresponding link-time library that will take care of
opening the library. So if your programs uses reqtools.library you add
``-lreqtools`` to the gcc command.

.. Note:: To summarise: when using the AROS gcc compiler the usage of shared
   libraries becomes very easy and can be done in two steps:
   
   + Use an include statement to declare the functions of the library::
     
       #include <proto/reqtools.h>
       
   + Add an extra link library if the library is not auto-opened by gcc::
   
       % i386-linux-aros-gcc ... -lreqtools
       
Auto-opening by the AROS' build system
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Auto-opening libraries by the build system is very similar to using the AROS
gcc compiler. Analog to specifying a ``-l`` option you specify the libs you
use in the ``uselibs`` parameter to the ``%build_prog`` and the
``%build_module`` macro. More information can be found in `build system
tutorial`__.

__ buildsystem#build-system-tutorial

Manually open libraries
'''''''''''''''''''''''

To open a library you have to use a function of `exec.library`::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    struct Library *OpenLibrary( STRPTR name, ULONG version );

`OpenLibrary()` takes two arguments:

name
    points to the name of the library. Normally this is just the plain name, but
    this can also be a complete (absolute or relative) path to the library.

    .. Note:: Paths do not work with kernel-based libraries
              (i.e. libraries that are included in the kernel).
              Use absolute path only, if you know exactly, what you
              are doing!

version
    is the minimal version of the library to open. If the named library is
    found, but its version is lower than `version`, the library will not be
    opened, but an error will be returned. Versions are important, because
    libraries are supposed to be expandable. Some functions are only available
    from a certain version of a library on. For example the function
    `AllocVec()` of `exec.library` was introduced in version 36 of the library.
    If you try to call this function with lower versions of `exec.library`
    installed, unexpected things will happen (most likely the application will
    crash).

The following procedure is used to load the library to open:

1. First, the name of the library is searched in the list of already loaded
   libraries. If this library was loaded into memory before (e.g. by a different
   program) and still is there, everything is fine and `OpenLibrary()` returns
   now.

   Libraries in the kernel are always on list of loaded libraries.

   .. Note:: Comparisons in this list are case sensitive! Be sure to use the
             right case in `name`. Normally all characters in a library name
             are lower-case.

2. If the library was not found in the resident list and a path was supplied
   with `name`, the given file is tried to be opened. If this fails,
   `OpenLibrary()` returns an error.

3. If only the plain library-name was given, the library is searched in the
   `current directory` first. If it's not found there, it is searched in
   the directory `LIBS:`.


`OpenLibrary()` returns either a pointer to a structure, describing the
library (`struct Library *` defined in ``exec/libraries.h``) or `NULL`,
meaning that opening the library failed for some reason. The resulting pointer
has to be stored for the compiler's use. Normally it is stored in a variable in
the form: `<libraryname>Base`, e.g. `IntuitionBase` for the pointer to
*intuition.library*.

After opening the library, you can use its functions by just calling them like
any other function in your program. But to let your compiler know, what to do,
you have to include the library-specific header-file. This is normally called
*proto/<libraryname>.h* for C compilers.

When you have finished using the library you have to close it again to free the
resources used by it. This is performed with::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    void CloseLibrary( struct Library *base );


`CloseLibrary()` closes the library pointed to by `base`. This may
also be `NULL`, in which case `CloseLibrary()` does nothing.

We will demonstrate the use of libraries by creating a small graphical
hello-world program. Instead of printing ``Hello World!`` to the console, we
will display it in a requester. A function to display a requester is
`EasyRequestArgs()`, being a function of *intuition.library*. We will
not discuss its usage here. For more information, see the section about
`Requesters`.

Example usage of libraries::

    #include <proto/exec.h>          /* OpenLibrary() and CloseLibrary() */
    #include <exec/libraries.h>      /* struct Library */
    #include <dos/dos.h>             /* RETURN_OK and RETURN_FAIL */
    #include <proto/intuition.h>     /* EasyRequestArgs() */
    #include <intuition/intuition.h> /* struct EasyStruct */

    /* This variable will store the pointer to intuition.library */
    struct Library *IntuitionBase;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        /* Needed for EasyRequestArgs(). */
        struct EasyStruct es = {
          sizeof(struct EasyStruct), 0UL,
          "Requester", "Hello World!", "Ok"
        };

        /* First, we open intuition.library. We need version 36 or better,
           because EasyRequestArgs() was introduced in that version of
           intuition.library.
        */
        IntuitionBase = OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 36);

        /* We have to check, if intuition.library was successfully opened.
           If it was not, we must not call a function from it, so we return
           immediately with an error.
        */
        if (!IntuitionBase)
            return RETURN_FAIL;

        /* After opening intuition.library, we can call EasyRequestArgs(). */
        EasyRequestArgs(NULL, &es, NULL, NULL);

        /* At last, we have to close intuition.library again. */
        CloseLibrary(IntuitionBase);

        return RETURN_OK;
    }

Try to compile and run this program. It should present you a
handsome hello-world requester.

Versioning of libraries
.......................

Shared libraries may evolve over time and new features may be introduced.
When now a program uses a feature of a more recent and it is run on a machine
that has an older version of the library this will most likely lead to a
crash. Therefor versioning of libraries is introduced so programs can check if
the version of a library and quit gracefully or reduce the functionality
accordingly. On AROS and amiga-like systems the version is determined by a
major number an a minor number (also resp. called version and revision).
A new major number indicates the introduction of new features and an
increase of the minor number just indicates some optimizations and/or
bug fixes but with compatibility. A version of a library is often presented
as major.minor [#]_ and can be retrieved with the version dos command::

  5.System:> version dos.library
  dos.library 41.7
  
When opening a library you can provide a version number and the opening will
fail if the version of the library is lower then this value::

  mylibbase = OpenLibrary("my.library", 2);
  
This will return NULL is only version 1 of my.library is installed. If you
use auto-opening of libraries the library will be opened with the version of
the library used during link time. This version can be overloaded with a
variable named libbasename_version. At the moment the version of dos.library
is 41 and this means that programs compiled will only run on other systems
that have version 41 of dos.library. If you are sure to only use feature up
to version 36 you can let your program on these systems with the following
statement somewhere in your code::

  const LONG DOSBase_version = 36;
  
The consequence for libraries is that they always have to be backwards
compatible: if the version of your library is 41 but the program was
compiled for version 36 it still need to run without problem. Therefor a
function at a certain place in the lookup table always has to perform the
exact same function even for newer version of the library.

If you really want to change the behaviour of the function with a certain
name you could do that by putting it at another place in the lookup table.
At the old location you put then a compatibility function that is still
compatible with the behaviour in older library versions. This was for
example done for the exec function `OpenLibrary`, in the first version of
AmigaOS it did not have a version parameter and was put at location 68. In
a later version an `OpenLibrary` function was introduced that included a
version parameter and put at location 92. The function at position 68 was
renamed to `OldOpenLibrary`.

.. [#] Contrary to what some people think the major.minor version is not a
       numeric value: the revision coming after 1.9 is 1.10 and 1.09 is not
       a valid version number on AmigaOS.

Difference with other run-time library systems
..............................................

The AROS shared libraries have an unique architecture with it's advantanges
and disadvantages. Some aspects will be further discussed in this chapter.
As reference most of the time Windows and UNIX(-like) systems will be taken.

Loading of the shared libraries
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

On AROS the dynamic link libraries are relocatable ELF objects. The first
time a library is opened it is loaded from disk and relocated with the start
address it was loaded to. AROS and amiga like systems share one big memory
region between all code running on the system. This means all programs can
use the library loaded at the memory it wad loaded to.

Other systems, including Windows and UNIX, have a different virtual address
space for each process. Here also the OS tries to load the shared library
only once and then try to map the same library in the address space of each
of the processes using the library. The library may thus be located at
different addresses in the different spaces and the OS has to handle this
situation.

On Windows one tries to locate the shared library at a certain
location in memory and tries to map it to the same memory in each process
that uses the library. If this is not possible the library will be duplicated
in memory. On most UNIX systems this problem is avoided by letting the compiler
generate position independent code, e.g. code that works at any position in
memory without having to relocate the code. Depending on the architecture this
type of code may have less or more impact on the speed of the generated code.

Dynamic linking of functions
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Programmers that use a higher level languages for accessing the functions in
a shared library will use the name of the function it wants to use. When a
microprocessor executes a program it uses memory addresses to jump to a
certain function. At one point the name used by the programmer has to be
translated into a memory address.

On amiga the translation happens when the code is compiled or when a program
or module is linked. Every libbase of an AROS library contains a lookup
table for the functions of the library. During compilation (or linking) the
name of a function is translated into a position in this table where the
address of the function can be found [#]_. Functions in an AROS shared
library are thus accessed with one level of indirection. Depending on the
CPU architecture this level of indirection may have more or less influence
on the speed of the code. Luckily similar type of indirection is used for
calling virtual functions of C++ classes and this most modern CPUs are
optimized to handle the indirection without (big) impact on the speed.
As the lookup table is attached to the libbase it needs to be duplicated for
libraries that use a per-opener base.

On Windows and UNIX-like systems the translation of the name of a function
to an address is done when the program is loaded and linked at run-time with
shared library [#]_. When the program is linked at compile time a list of 
libraries is put in the executable together with a list of the functions to
be used. These lists are ASCII strings. When the program is then loaded it
will convert the functions names to it's addresses (or to a pointer in a
lookup table). First are the libraries in the library list opened,
afterwards each of the functions is looked up in the libraries. Different
mechanism are used for the lookup of the function names. For example on
Windows the functions available ar put in a sorted array so a binary search
can be performed and on Linux hashes are used to speed up the lookup.

Global and static variables in libraries
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

As said in a previous paragraph AROS shared libraries are only loaded into
memory and initialised once. This has also impact on the way global and
static variables are handled. You can declare a global variable in the source
code of your library in the following way::

  int globvar;
  
This will create a global variable that is accessible in all parts of the
library. Once the shared library is loaded into memory your variable
will also be located in the memory taken by the library and will always stay
at the same location until the library is unloaded from memory. Static
variables defined in a function are handled in an analog way. This also
means that the code in the library accessing a global variable will always go
to the same location no matter how many times the library is opened or which
program called the library code. Currently the only way to have a variable
that has a different value per opener of the library is to have a library
with a per-opener base and store the library in this base. At the moment also
global variables are not exported from AROS shared libraries. They can only be
accessed inside the library itself, program using a library can not access the
library's global variables directly. In this respect variables in AROS shared
libraries are handled differently then variables in link-time libraries. A global
variable defined in a link-time library is also accessible by the program to which
the library is linked and every program linked with the same link-time
library will have it's own version of the global variable.

On UNIX, shared libraries were introduced after the link-time libraries were
already used heavily. One of the design goals was then to make the
behaviour of the shared libraries the same as link-time libraries.
Therefor a copy is made of the variables every time a program opens a shared
library. In this way every program that has opened a shared library will
have it's own set of the global variables. Also the global variables of a
shared library are automatically exported from that library so they can also
be accessed direclty in the program using that library.

On Windows one can choose the behaviour of global variables to be like the AROS
way or the UNIX way but by default it is handled as is done on UNIX.

For porting shared libraries to AROS or amiga this different handling of
variables has to be taken into account. Some libraries depend on how
variables are handled in UNIX and Windows shared libraries and may be
difficult to port to AROS.

.. Note::
   The explanation in this paragraph describes how the
   handling of data in shared libraries worked when the text was written.
   At that time there was also discussion of how to extend this to also
   allow handling similar to the handling done by other library types.

Libraries using other libraries
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

A library can open another library. When a library opens another library it
will get a libbase for that library. This means that a library that has
a per-opener base will return a unique libbase to another library.
When a program opens a library with a per-opener base it will get a libbase
back. When now the program opens a second library that again also opens the
first library then a different libbase will be used in the second library
then in the program. Programmers of libraries with a per-opener libbase have
to take this into account.

As was already discussed before on UNIX and Windows everything is based on
processes. When a program is loaded a new process is created, every shared
library used in that process will only be dynamically linked once into the
process. This means that a program and shared library that both access a
second shared library will use the same instance of that shared library.
Again this different behavior may make porting shared libraries from
UNIX/Windows difficult.

.. Note::
   Again, the explanation in this paragraph describes how the
   handling of opening shared libraries from a library worked when the text
   was written.
   At that time there was also discussion of how to extend this to also
   allow handling similar to the handling done by other library types.

.. [#] In reality, on certain flavours, this table may hold more than just
       function pointers. On AROS for 68k, in fact, where binary compatibility
       with AmigaOS (TM) is an issue, every entry in the table contains a JMP
       instruction followed by the function address (which is thus part of the
       JMP opcode), and the user programs don't jump to the address in the
       vector, they jump to the vector itself, and then the JMP instruction
       redirects the program's flow to the right function.

.. [#] FIXME: a.out shared libraries, cardinal on Windows, ...

Giving additional arguments with taglists
-----------------------------------------

Every library function takes a fixed number of arguments. This poses quite
a problem with complex functions that would need a lot of arguments. To avoid
this problem, so-called taglists were introduced. In ``utility/tagitem.h`` we
find a structure `TagItem`, which contains the members `ti_Tag` and `ti_Data`.
A taglist contains of an array of this structure. The size of the list is not
limited. The field `ti_Tag` is an identifier (often referred to as Tag) that
declares what `ti_Data` contains. `ti_Data` is either an integer or a pointer.
It is guaranteed to be at least of the size of a long-word or a pointer
(whichever is bigger).

In every description of a function that uses a tag-list, all possible tags are
listed. Functions have to ignore unknown tags and use defaults for tags not
provided, so taglists are a very flexible way of providing arguments to
a function.

There are some special tags that all functions understand
(defined in ``utility/tagitem.h``):


`TAG_DONE` and `TAG_END`
    Define the end of a taglist. Every taglist must be terminated with
    one of it. A following `ti_Data` must be ignored by the called function,
    so it doesn't have to exist in memory.

`TAG_IGNORE`
    means that the contents of `ti_Data` is to be ignored. This tag is
    especially useful for conditional inclusion of tags.

`TAG_MORE`
    By using this tag, you can link taglists together. `ti_Data` points to
    another taglist. Processing of the current taglist will be stopped and
    instead the new one will be processed. This tag also terminates the current
    taglist.

`TAG_SKIP`
    forces the parser to skip the next `ti_Data` tags. They will not be
    processed.

You may always provide `NULL` instead of a pointer to a taglist. All functions
must be able to handle `NULL` pointers. They are equal to taglists with
`TAG_DONE` as first tag.

A function that requires a taglist is::

    #include <proto/intuition.h>

    struct Window *OpenWindowTagList
    (
        struct NewWindow *newwin, struct TagList *taglist
    );

This function will be discussed in detail in the
.. FIXME:: *chapter about windows*.
For
now you only have to know that this function opens a new window. We set the
argument `newwin` to ``NULL``. The only tags looked at for now are:

==========  ===============================  ========
Tag         Description                      Type
==========  ===============================  ========
WA_Width    Width of window in pixels        UWORD

Another function we need for our small example is::

    #include <proto/intuition.h>

    void CloseWindow( struct Window *window );

This function is used to close an opened window.

Now let's have a look at another small hello-world-program. This opens a window,
which says "Hello World!" in the title-bar, for two seconds::

    #include <proto/exec.h>
    #include <exec/libraries.h>
    #include <proto/dos.h>
    #include <proto/intuition.h>
    #include <intuition/intuition.h>

    struct DosLibrary    *DOSBase;
    struct IntuitionBase *IntuitionBase;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int error = RETURN_OK;

        /* We need this for Delay() later on. */
        DOSBase = (struct DosLibrary *)OpenLibrary("dos.library", 36);
        if (DOSBase)
        {
            IntuitionBase = (struct IntuitionBase *)OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 36);
            if (IntuitionBase)
            {
                struct Window *win;
                /* We set up our tags. */
                struct TagItem tags[] =
                {
                    { WA_Width, 100                  },
                    { WA_Height, 50                  },
                    { WA_Title, (IPTR)"Hello World!" },
                    { TAG_DONE, 0UL                  }
                };

                win = OpenWindowTagList(NULL, tags);
                if (win)
                {
                    /* Now wait for two seconds, so we can look at our nice
                       window.
                    */
                    Delay(100);

                    /* We close our window again. */
                    CloseWindow(win);
                }

                CloseLibrary((struct Library *)IntuitionBase);
            }
            else
                error = RETURN_FAIL;

            CloseLibrary((struct Library *)DOSBase);
        } else
            error = RETURN_FAIL;

        return error;
    }

Of course, this method of setting up the taglist is quite complicated. So for
most functions that use taglists short-cuts are available. The link-library
`amiga.lib` provides these short-cuts for all internal AROS functions. These
varargs versions can be used like this:

    #include <proto/alib.h>

    Function( arg1, ..., argn, TAG1, data1, ..., TAG_DONE );

Our example above would look like this, using the varargs version of
`OpenWindowTagList()`, called `OpenWindowTags()`::

    [...]

    if( IntuitionBase )
    {
        struct Window *win;

        win = OpenWindowTags
        (
            NULL, WA_Width, 100, WA_Height, 20,
            WA_Title, "Hello World!", TAG_DONE
        );
        )
        if( win )
        {

    [...]

Much easier, isn't it?


Getting more documentation
==========================

"Hello, World!" is not a Museum of Programmer's Talent, so you might wonder if
there is more to AROS than that. Why dear, of course there is. But this 
guide is not a Programmer's Guide nor a Programmer's Reference Guide. Such
guides might be written in the future, but for now, the best AROS Programmer's
Guides you can find are the books that have been written for the Amiga, and
the best reference for AROS are the AROS `autodocs <./../autodocs/index>`__ (autodocs
are descriptions of AROS library functions that are created by parsing the
AROS sources).
But they are mainly useful to advanced Amiga programmers: they only provide a
very short explanation for each function. If you have to learn AROS programming
from the beginning, you really should try to find that old Amiga book, or buy
the Amiga Developer CDRom.
