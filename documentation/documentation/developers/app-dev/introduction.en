Introduction

Developing for the AROS platform
================================

This chapter explains how to develop programs that will run on the AROS
platform.  It also tells you how to compile them on the different machines that
AROS runs on. It assumes that you have an average knowledge of the C language
and basic concepts like `linking`.


The "Hello, World!" program
----------------------------

Below is a program that shows a "Hello, World!" message - a programmer's
tradition since ages::

  #include <stdio.h>

  int main(void)
  {
    puts("Hello World");      
    return 0;
  }


Compiling on Linux with GCC
---------------------------

Under AROS/hosted you are using a configured version of the Linux GCC. 
There is a difference depending on whether you use the compiled version
of AROS (i386-linux-system) or you compile the source yourself:

+ i386-linux-system

  You have to download the package `i386-all-sdk`. Unpack it, cd into the
  created directory and start the script `AROS-SDK-Install`. Follow the instructions.

+ self-compiled

  The AROS compiler has the path `AROS/bin/linux-i386/tools`. Add this path to your
  Linux paths.
  
In both cases the name of the C compiler is i386-linux-aros-gcc. You have to
start it from the Linux side.

You will find additional tools in the path of the AROS C compiler:
AROS versions of ld, ranlib, the catalog compiler Flexcat, etc.

.. Note:: If you are using i386-linux-aros-strip you have to add the parameters
   `--strip-unneeded --remove-section .comment`. Otherwise strip will create 
   corrupt binaries.
 

Compiling for native-i386
-------------------------

A native version of the compiler GCC is included.


Concepts
========

Include files
-------------

AROS comes with a variety of include files. They are placed in `sys:Development/include`.
The subdirectory `proto` contains include files with function prototypes for the
system libraries. In `libraries` are headers with structures and defines.
Some of the bigger libraries like `Intuition` have their own directory
with headers.


How AROS libraries work
-----------------------

The term `library` usually refers to an object whose purpose is to collect in a
single place functions that programs may want to use more often than others,
and usually such functions all serve one common purpose, so that there can be
libraries to parse configuration files, to handle localization, and other kind
of tasks which a program might want to perform.

There are generally are 2 kinds of libraries: link-time libraries, and run-time
libraries. The link time libraries, as the name suggests, are used only at
program linking stage: the linker simply takes note of which functions the main
program references and tries to take them from the provided libraries. The
run-time ones, instead, are only used when the program is run, that is the
operating system, the program itself or even a link-time library.
Whilst link-time libraries are handled more or less the same way across all
operating systems, since they're independent from the OS itself, run-time
libraries may be handled differently by different OSs.

AROS `shared` libraries are collections of functions indexed in the library by
a `function vectors table`. This table is simply an array of pointers [#]_ to
the library's functions, and user programs access these functions by knowing
their address' index in the table. Every function in the library gets passed a
parameter [#]_ which points to a zone of memory that both holds the function
vectors and the library's own data [#]_. Such memory area is named `library
base`, and libraries are free to choose, trough a particular implementation of
some of their mandatory functions, whether the library base is to be shared
among various instances of the library or if it's to be used by all of its
instances. User programs are generally not invited to access this area
directly, but rather trough the use of accessor functions, but again this is
not a mandatory policy, rather it's up to the library to decide how to do
certain things.

Libraries can of course `open` other libraries and use their functions and data
the way described above, but since the main program is not a library, libraries
have no means to access the program's data and functions other than the program
itself telling the interested library how to do so, in a way that is
library-dependent. 

Currently, in AROS, when a shared
object would be needed, a special wrapper around a shared library is built -
and certain tools used by the AROS build system can do this automatically - so
that programs can transparently use the shared version of what they think are
link-time, or `static` libraries. This approach only works in part, since it
doesn't replicate all functionalities of the shared objects, but it's
sufficient in many cases.

.. [#] In reality, on certain flavours, this table may hold more than just
       function pointers. On AROS for 68k, in fact, where binary compatibility
       with AmigaOS (TM) is an issue, every entry in the table contains a JMP
       instruction followed by the function address (which is thus part of the
       JMP opcode), and the user programs don't jump to the address in the
       vector, they jump to the vector itself, and then the JMP instruction
       redirects the program's flow to the right function.

.. [#] Such a parameter may be explicit or implicit, depending on the ABI
       chosen for a particular AROS flavour.

.. [#] If you know C++, you might think of the vectors table as the `VTable`
       used for virtual methods, and the library base pointer as the `this`
       pointer.



Shared libraries are the magic that make AROS work. Every library is
a collection of functions that fulfill a certain purpose. Normally functions
with a similar purpose are contained in one library. For example all the basic
memory handling functions are contained in `exec.library`.

Libraries are normally found in the `LIBS:` directory, but can also be stored at
other places. Some important libraries are not stored as a separate file, but
are contained in the kernel. Note that this the kernel libraries are different
from installation to installation, so don't depend on a specific library being
part of the kernel.

Here is a list of some important libraries and their function.
You don't have to remember all of these, as they will be discussed
later in detail.

+ `exec.library` is the most important library. It is responsible for handling
  the most basic things like managing `tasks` (ie programs), `memory`,
  `libraries` and many other  things.

+ `utility.library` implements very important mechanisms for "talking" to
  libraries: `taglists` that will be dicussed later in this chapter and `hooks`.
  Apart from that, utility contains miscellaneous small utility functions.

+ `dos.library` is responsible for file-handling and some basic I/O functions.
  Without dos, AROS would not be able to access files.

+ `intuition.library` handles `graphical user interfaces (GUIs)`. With Intuition
  you can create `windows` and `gadgets` and handle them accordingly. There are
  other libraries, which work on top of intuition and provide more sophisticated
  and more specialized GUI functions. Examples are `gadtools.library`, which
  implements some more complicated gadgets and `asl.library`, which provides
  file- and other `requesters`.


Usage of libraries
------------------

To use the functions of a library, you have to open the library
first. The only library that doesn't have to be opened first is
`exec.library`. Exec is always open and your compiler
knows how to access it. Your compiler may addtionally open some
libraries for you, so you don't have to open them manually. Read your
compiler's manual to learn about such features.

To open a library you have to use a function of `exec.library`::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    struct Library *OpenLibrary( STRPTR name, ULONG version );

`OpenLibrary()` takes two arguments:

name
    points to the name of the library. Normally this is just the plain name, but
    this can also be a complete (absolute or relative) path to the library.

    .. Note:: Paths do not work with kernel-based libraries
              (ie. libraries that are included in the kernel).
              Use absolute path only, if you know exactly, what you
              are doing!

version
    is the minimal version of the library to open. If the named library is
    found, but its version is lower than `version`, the library will not be
    opened, but an error will be returned. Versions are important, because
    libraries are supposed to be expandable. Some functions are only available
    from a certain version of a library on. For example the function
    `AllocVec()` of `exec.library` was introduced in version 36 of the library.
    If you try to call this function with lower versions of `exec.library`
    installed, unexpected things will happen (most likely the application will
    crash).

The following procedure is used to load the library to open:

1. First, the name of the library is searched in the list of already loaded
   libraries. If this library was loaded into memory before (eg. by a different
   program) and still is there, everything is fine and `OpenLibrary()` returns
   now.

   Libraries in the kernel are always on list of loaded libraries.

   .. Note:: Comparisons in this list are case sensitive! Be sure to use the
             right case in `name`. Normally all characters in a library name
             are lower-case.

2. If the library was not found in the resident list and a path was supplied
   with `name`, the given file is tried to be opened. If this fails,
   `OpenLibrary()` returns an error.

3. If only the plain library-name was given, the library is searched in the
   `current directory` first. If it's not found there, it is searched in
   the directory `LIBS:`.


`OpenLibrary()` returns either a pointer to a structure, describing the
library (`struct Library *` defined in ``exec/libraries.h``) or `NULL`,
meaning that opening the library failed for some reason. The resulting pointer
has to be stored for the compiler's use. Normally it is stored in a variable in
the form: `<libraryname>Base`, eg. `IntuitionBase` for the pointer to
*intuition.library*.

After opening the library, you can use its functions by just calling them like
any other function in your program. But to let your compiler know, what to do,
you have to include the library-specific header-file. This is normally called
*proto/<libraryname>.h* for C compilers.

When you have finished using the library you have to close it again to free the
resources used by it. This is performed with::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    void CloseLibrary( struct Library *base );


`CloseLibrary()` closes the library pointed to by `base`. This may
also be `NULL`, in which case `CloseLibrary()` does nothing.

We will demonstrate the use of libraries by creating a small graphical
hello-world program. Instead of printing ``Hello World!`` to the console, we
will display it in a requester. A function to display a requester is
`EasyRequestArgs()`, being a function of *intuition.library*. We will
not discuss its usage here. For more information, see the section about
`Requesters`.

Example usage of libraries::

    #include <proto/exec.h>          /* OpenLibrary() and CloseLibrary() */
    #include <exec/libraries.h>      /* struct Library */
    #include <dos/dos.h>             /* RETURN_OK and RETURN_FAIL */
    #include <proto/intuition.h>     /* EasyRequestArgs() */
    #include <intuition/intuition.h> /* struct EasyStruct */

    /* This variable will store the pointer to intuition.library */
    struct Library *IntuitionBase;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        /* Needed for EasyRequestArgs(). */
        struct EasyStruct es = {
          sizeof(struct EasyStruct), 0UL,
          "Requester", "Hello World!", "Ok"
        };

        /* First, we open intuition.library. We need version 36 or better,
           because EasyRequestArgs() was introduced in that version of
           intuition.library.
        */
        IntuitionBase = OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 36);

        /* We have to check, if intuition.library was successfully opened.
           If it was not, we must not call a function from it, so we return
           immediatly with an error.
        */
        if (!IntuitionBase)
            return RETURN_FAIL;

        /* After opening intuition.library, we can call EasyRequestArgs(). */
        EasyRequestArgs(NULL, &es, NULL, NULL);

        /* At last, we have to close intuition.library again. */
        CloseLibrary(IntuitionBase);

        return RETURN_OK;
    }

Try to compile and run this program. It should present you a
handsome hello-world requester.


Giving additional arguments with taglists
-----------------------------------------

Every library function takes a fixed number of arguments. This poses quite
a problem with complex functions that would need a lot of arguments. To avoid
this problem, so-called taglists were introduced. In ``utility/tagitem.h`` we
find a structure `TagItem`, which contains the members `ti_Tag` and `ti_Data`.
A taglist contains of an array of this structure. The size of the list is not
limited. The field `ti_Tag` is an identifier (often referred to as Tag) that
declares what `ti_Data` contains. `ti_Data` is either an integer or a pointer.
It is guaranteed to be at least of the size of a long-word or a pointer
(whichever is bigger).

In every description of a function that uses a tag-list, all possible tags are
listed. Functions have to ignore unknown tags and use defaults for tags not
provided, so taglists are a very flexible way of providing arguments to
a function.

There are some special tags that all functions understand
(defined in ``utility/tagitem.h``):


`TAG_DONE` and `TAG_END`
    Define the end of a taglist. Every taglist must be terminated with
    one of it. A following `ti_Data` must be ignored by the called function,
    so it doesn't have to exist in memory.

`TAG_IGNORE`
    means that the contents of `ti_Data` is to be ignored. This tag is
    especially useful for conditional inclusion of tags.

`TAG_MORE`
    By using this tag, you can link taglists together. `ti_Data` points to
    another taglist. Processing of the current taglist will be stopped and
    instead the new one will be processed. This tag also terminates the current
    taglist.

`TAG_SKIP`
    forces the parser to skip the next `ti_Data` tags. They will not be
    processed.

You may always provide `NULL` instead of a pointer to a taglist. All functions
must be able to handle `NULL` pointers. They are equal to taglists with
`TAG_DONE` as first tag.

A function that requires a taglist is::

    #include <proto/intuition.h>

    struct Window *OpenWindowTagList
    (
        struct NewWindow *newwin, struct TagList *taglist
    );

This function will be discussed in detail in the
.. FIXME:: *chapter about windows*.
For
now you only have to know that this function opens a new window. We set the
argument `newwin` to ``NULL``. The only tags looked at for now are:

==========  ===============================  ========
Tag         Description                      Type
==========  ===============================  ========
WA_Width    Width of window in pixels        UWORD
WA_Height   Height of window in pixels       UWORD
WA_Title    Window title                     STRPTR
==========  ===============================  ========

Another function we need for our small example is::

    #include <proto/intuition.h>

    void CloseWindow( struct Window *window );

This function is used to close an opened window.

Now let's have a look at another small hello-world-program. This opens a window,
which says "Hello World!" in the title-bar, for two seconds::

    #include <proto/exec.h>
    #include <exec/libraries.h>
    #include <proto/dos.h>
    #include <proto/intuition.h>
    #include <intuition/intuition.h>

    struct DosLibrary    *DOSBase;
    struct IntuitionBase *IntuitionBase;

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        int error = RETURN_OK;

        /* We need this for Delay() later on. */
        DOSBase = (struct DosLibrary *)OpenLibrary("dos.library", 36);
        if (DOSBase)
        {
            IntuitionBase = (struct IntuitionBase *)OpenLibrary("intuition.library", 36);
            if (IntuitionBase)
            {
                struct Window *win;
                /* We set up our tags. */
                struct TagItem tags[] =
                {
                    { WA_Width, 100                  },
                    { WA_Height, 50                  },
                    { WA_Title, (IPTR)"Hello World!" },
                    { TAG_DONE, 0UL                  }
                };

                win = OpenWindowTagList(NULL, tags);
                if (win)
                {
                    /* Now wait for two seconds, so we can look at our nice
                       window.
                    */
                    Delay(100);

                    /* We close our window again. */
                    CloseWindow(win);
                }

                CloseLibrary((struct Library *)IntuitionBase);
            }
            else
                error = RETURN_FAIL;

            CloseLibrary((struct Library *)DOSBase);
        } else
            error = RETURN_FAIL;

        return error;
    }

Of course, this method of setting up the taglist is quite complicated. So for
most functions that use taglists short-cuts are available. The link-library
`amiga.lib` provides these short-cuts for all internal AROS functions. These
varargs versions can be used like this:

    #include <proto/alib.h>

    Function( arg1, ..., argn, TAG1, data1, ..., TAG_DONE );

Our example above would look like this, using the varargs version of
`OpenWindowTagList()`, called `OpenWindowTags()`::

    [...]

    if( IntuitionBase )
    {
        struct Window *win;

        win = OpenWindowTags
        (
            NULL, WA_Width, 100, WA_Height, 20,
            WA_Title, "Hello World!", TAG_DONE
        );
        )
        if( win )
        {

    [...]

Much easier, isn't it?


Getting more documentation
==========================

"Hello, World!" is not a Museum of Programmer's Talent, so you might wonder if
there is more to AROS than that. Why dear, of course there is. But this 
guide is not a Programmer's Guide nor a Programmer's Reference Guide. Such
guides might be written in the future, but for now, the best AROS Programmer's
Guides you can find are the books that have been written for the Amiga, and
the best reference for AROS are the AROS `autodocs <./../autodocs/index>`__ (autodocs
are descriptions of AROS library functions that are created by parsing the
AROS sources).
But they are mainly useful to advanced Amiga programmers: they only provide a
very short explanation for each function. If you have to learn AROS programming
from the beginning, you really should try to find that old Amiga book, or buy
the Amiga Developer CDRom.
