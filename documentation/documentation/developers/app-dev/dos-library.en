Program execution
=================

All AROS programs must return a program execution status. This status
expresses, whether the program was executed successful, and if not, how
serious the case of failure was. In `dos/dos.h` the following constants are
defined, which represent the standard return states:

+ `RETURN_OK` is returned if the program executed successfully.

+ `RETURN_WARN` means that the program executed successfully, but there was
  something not quite right. For example, this could be returned if a
  temporary file could not be deleted after use.

  `RETURN_WARN` is also returned to express a boolean state. In this case
  `RETURN_WARN` means true, while `RETURN_OK` means false.

+ `RETURN_ERROR` is returned on errors that caused the execution of the
  program to fail partly.

+ `RETURN_FAIL` is returned if the execution of the program failed
  completely.

+ As an alternative you can use the ANSI C return codes EXIT_SUCCESS and
  EXIT_FAILURE.

Links
-----

Links are a method to apply multiple filenames to the same physical file or
directory. This way, the file can be available in multiple directories with
different filenames. There are two different types of links: hard links and
soft links. A soft link is just a reference to another file by its name. This
name may be stated as relative or absolute path. If a soft link is accessed,
AROS tries to resolve the name of the file the link points to and redirects
all actions to that file. Of course, the file pointed to does not have to
exist. It may have been deleted after the link was created. Hard links are
added entries for the same file. They don't reference the file by its name,
they directly access its content. Normally, a hard link can't be distinguished
from the original filename; effectively the file has been given a second
name. Obviously, while soft links can link from one volume to another, hard
links are always on one volume with the original entry for the file.

.. Note::

    Not all file systems support both types of links or any links at all.

Tasks, Processes and the Shell
------------------------------

Tasks
~~~~~

AROS is a multitasking operating system. This essentially means that multiple
programs may be run at the same time. Every program running is called a task.
But there are also tasks that are not user-programs. There are, for example,
tasks handling the file-system and tasks watching the input devices. Every
task gets a certain amount of time, in which it is running. After this time
it's the next task's turn; the system reschedules the tasks.

Plain tasks are very limited in their capabilities. Plain tasks must not call
a function of ``dos.library`` or a function that could call a function of
``dos.library`` (this includes ``OpenLibrary()`` for most cases!). Processes_
don't have this limitation.


The Task Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A task is described by a struct ``Task`` as defined in ``exec/tasks.h``.
This structure contains information about the task like the its stack, its
signals and some management data. To get the address of a task structure,
use::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    struct Task *FindTask( STRPTR name );

The ``name`` is a pointer to the name of the task to find. *Note that this
name is case-sensitive!* If the named task is not found, ``NULL`` is
returned, otherwise a pointer to a ``struct Task`` is returned .

To get a pointer to the current task, supply ``NULL`` as ``name``. This can
never fail.

The task structure contains a field called ``tc_UserData``. You can use this
for your own purposes. It's ignored by AROS.


States
^^^^^^

A task must be in one of following states (as set in the field
`tc_State` of the task structure):

TS_INVALID
    This state should never be set!

TS_ADDED
    FIXME

TS_RUN
    The task is currently running. On single processor architectures, only
    one task can be in that state.

TS_READY
    The task is waiting for its activation.

TS_WAIT
    The task is waiting on some
    .. FIXME: *signal*.
    As long as this does not occur, the program doesn't become active; it is
    ignored on rescheduling. Most interactive programs are in this state
    most of the time, as they wait for user input.

TS_EXCEPT
    The task is in an exception.

TS_REMOVED
    FIXME

.. Note::

    Do not set these states yourself, unless you know exactly what you are
    doing!


Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^

The field ``tc_Node.ln_Pri`` of the ``struct Node`` embedded in the task
structure (see ``exec/nodes.h`` and the
.. FIXME:: *section about exec lists*
)
specifies the priority of the task. Possible priorities reach from ``-128``
to ``127``. The higher the priority the more processor time the task gets
from the system. To set a task's priority use the function::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    BYTE SetTaskPri( struct Task *task, BYTE newpri );

The old priority is returned.


Stack
^^^^^

Every task has a stack. A stack is a piece of memory in which a tasks stores
its temporary data. Compilers, for example, use the stack to store variables,
you use in your programs. On many architectures, the stack is also used to
supply library functions with parameters.

The size of the stack is limited. Therefore only a certain amount of data
can be stored in the stack. The stack-size of a task is chosen by its caller
and must be at least 4096 bytes. Tasks should generally not assume that their
stack-size is bigger. So, if a task needs more stack, the stack can be
exchanged by using the function::

    #include <proto/exec.h>

    void StackSwap( struct StackSwapStruct *sss );

The only argument, ``sss``, is a pointer to a ``struct StackSwapStruct`` as
defined in ``exec/tasks.h``.

``struct StackSwapStack`` must contain a pointer to the beginning of the new
stack (``strk_Lower``), to the end of the new stack (``stk_Upper``) and a new
stack-pointer (``stk_Pointer``). This stack-pointer is normally set either to
the same address as ``stk_Lower`` or to the same address as ``stk_Upper``,
depending on the kind of CPU used.

When calling `StackSwap()`, the ``StackSwapStruct`` structure supplied as
``sss`` will be filled with information about the current stack.

After finishing using the new stack, the old stack must be restored by
calling `StackSwap()` a second time with the same ``StackSwapStruct``.

.. Note::

    Normally, only compilers need this function. Handle it with great care as
    different architectures use the stack in different ways!



Processes
~~~~~~~~~

A process is an expanded task. Different from a task, it can use functions of
dos.library, because a process structure contains some special fields,
concerning files and directories. But of course, all functions that can be
used on tasks can also be used on processes.


The Process Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A process is described by a ``struct Process`` as defined in
``dos/dosextens.h``. The first field in ``struct Process`` is an embedded
``struct Task``. The extra fields include information about the file-system,
the console, the process is connected to, and miscellaneous other stuff.



Creating own Tasks and Processes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are mainly two methods of creating tasks and processes: you can either
call an external program (i.e. open an executable file and run the program
contained in it) or you can execute a piece of code, already in memory.


Starting External Programs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

External programs are always processes.
FIXME



Expanded Error Diagnostics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most functions of `dos.library` set the secondary error-code of the process
structure on error. This way the caller can determine, why a certain
system-call failed. Imagine, the function `Open()`, which opens a named
file, fails. There can be multiple reasons for this: maybe the file named
doesn't exist, maybe it is read protected. To find this out, you can query
the secondary error-code set by the last function by using::

    #include <proto/dos.h>

    LONG IoErr()

DOS-functions return one of the ``ERROR_`` definitions from ``dos/dos.h``.
Applications can, of course, process these error-codes as well (which is
useful in many cases), but often we just want to inform the user what went
wrong. (Applications normally need not care if a file could not be
opened because it did not exist or because it was read protected.) To output
human-readable error messages, dos.library provides two functions::

    #include <proto/dos.h>

    LONG Fault( LONG code, STRPTR header, STRPTR buffer, LONG length );
    BOOL PrintFault( LONG code, STRPTR header );

While `PrintFault()` simply prints an error message to the `standard output`,
`Fault()` fills a supplied buffer with the message. Both functions take
a ``code`` argument. This is the code to be converted into a string. You can
also supply a ``header`` string, which will prefix the error message.
The ``header`` may be ``NULL``, in which case nothing is prefixed.

`Fault()` also required a pointer to a ``buffer``, which is to be filled with
the converted string. The ``length`` of this buffer (in bytes) is to be
passed in as the last argument. The total number of characters put into the
buffer is returned. You are on the safe side, if your buffer has a size of
83 character plus the size of the header.

Examples for the use of these functions can be found in later chapters,
especially in the chapter about
.. FIXME:: *Files and Directories*.

Secondary error-codes from a program are handed back to the caller. If this
is a shell, the secondary error-code will be put into the field
``cli_Result2`` of the shell structure (struct ``CommandLineInterface`` as
defined in ``dos/dosextens.h`` and
.. FIXME:: *discussed later*.

You can also set the secondary error-code yourself. This way, you can either
to pass it back to another function in your program or to your caller. To
set the secondary error, use::

    #include <proto/dos.h>

    LONG SetIoErr( LONG code );

``code`` is the new secondary error-code and the old secondary error-code is
returned.
