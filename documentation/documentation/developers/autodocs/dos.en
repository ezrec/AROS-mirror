AbortPkt
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void AbortPkt(
         struct MsgPort   * port,
         struct DosPacket * pkt
 );


AddBuffers
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG AddBuffers(
         CONST_STRPTR devicename,
         LONG numbuffers
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Add or remove cache memory from a filesystem.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     devicename  --  NUL terminated dos device name.
     numbuffers  --  Number of buffers to add. May be negative.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 on success (IoErr() gives the actual number of buffers),
     0 else (IoErr() gives the error code).



AddDosEntry
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG AddDosEntry(
         struct DosList * dlist
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a given dos list entry to the dos list. Automatically
     locks the list for writing. There may be not more than one device
     or assign node of the same name. There are no restrictions on
     volume nodes.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dlist - pointer to dos list entry.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 if all went well, 0 otherwise.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Since anybody who wants to use a device or volume node in the
     dos list has to lock the list, filesystems may be called with
     the dos list locked. So if you want to add a dos list entry
     out of a filesystem don't just wait on the lock but serve all
     incoming requests until the dos list is free instead.



AddPart
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AddPart(
         STRPTR dirname,
         CONST_STRPTR filename,
         ULONG size
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     AddPart() will add a file, directory or other path name to a
     directory path. It will take into account any pre-existing
     separator characters (':','/').

     If filename is a fully qualified path, then it will replace
     the current value of dirname.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dirname     -   the path to add the new path to
     filename    -   the path you wish added
     size        -   The size of the dirname buffer, must NOT be 0


Result
~~~~~~
::

     non-zero if everything succeed, FALSE if the buffer would have
     overflowed.

     If the buffer would have overflowed, then dirname will not have
     been changed.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     UBYTE buffer[128];
     buffer[0]='\0';
     AddPart(buffer, "Work:", 80);
     AddPart(buffer, "Programming/Include/exec");

     FPuts(Output(), buffer);
     --> Work:Programming/Include/exec

     AddPart(buffer, "/graphics", 80);

     FPuts(Output(), buffer);
     --> Work:Programming/Include/graphics

     AddPart(buffer, "gfxmacros.h", 80);
     FPuts(Output(), buffer);
     --> Work:Programming/Include/graphics/gfxmacros.h

AddSegment
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AddSegment(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         BPTR seg,
         LONG type
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Adds a program segment to the system resident list. You can later
     use these segments to run programs.

     The name field should refer to a NULL terminated strings, which
     will be copied. The type field determines the type of resident
     program. Normal programs should have type >= 0, system segments
     should have type == CMD_SYSTEM.

     Note that all other values of type are reserved.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name            - Name of the segment. This is used by FindSegment().
     seg             - Segment to add.
     type            - What type of segment (initial use count).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Segment will have been added to the DOS resident list.

     != 0    success
     == 0    failure


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Uses Forbid() based locking.

AllocDosObject
==============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 APTR AllocDosObject(
         ULONG type,
         struct TagItem * tags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Creates a new dos object of a given type. This memory has to be
     freed with FreeDosObject().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     type - Object type.
     tags - Pointer to taglist array with additional information. See
            <dos/dostags.h> for a list of all supported tags.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to new object or NULL, to indicate an error.



AssignAdd
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AssignAdd(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a multi-directory assign, or adds to it if it already was one.
     Do not use or free the lock after calling this function - it becomes
     the assign and will be freed by the system when the assign is removed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - NULL terminated name of the assign.
     lock - Lock on the assigned directory.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 success, 0 on failure. IoErr() gives additional information
     in that case. The lock is not freed on failure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This will only work with an assign created with AssignLock() or
     a resolved AssignLate() assign.


See also
~~~~~~~~
::

     Lock(), AssignLock(), AssignPath(), AssignLate(), DupLock(),
     RemAssignList()



AssignLate
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AssignLate(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         CONST_STRPTR path
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create an assign for the given name, which will be resolved upon the
     first reference to it. If this succeeds (i.e. the path exists and
     can be locked) it will be turned into an AssignLock() type assign.
     This way you can create assigns to unmounted volumes which will only
     be requested when accessed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name  --  NULL terminated name of the assign.
     path  --  NULL terminated path to be resolved on the first reference.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 success, 0 on failure. IoErr() gives additional information
     in that case.


See also
~~~~~~~~
::

     Lock(), AssignAdd(), AssignPath(), AssignLock()



AssignLock
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AssignLock(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create an assign from a given name to a lock. Replaces any older
     assignments from that name, 0 cancels the assign completely. Do not
     use or free the lock after calling this function - it becomes
     the assign and will be freed by the system if the assign is removed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name -- NUL terminated name of the assign.
     lock -- Lock to assigned directory.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 success, 0 on failure. IoErr() gives additional information
     in that case. The lock is not freed on failure.



AssignPath
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL AssignPath(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         CONST_STRPTR path
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create an assign for the given name, which will be resolved upon
     each reference to it. There will be no permanent lock kept on the
     specified path. This way you can create assigns to unmounted volumes
     which will only be requested when accessed. Also, using AssignPath()
     to assign C: to df0:c would make references go to to df0:c even if
     you change the disk.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name  -- NULL terminated name of the assign.
     path  -- NULL terminated path to be resolved on each reference.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 in case of success, 0 on failure. IoErr() gives additional
     information in that case.

~~~~~~~~
::

     AssignAdd(), AssignLock(), AssignLate(), Open()



AttemptLockDosList
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct DosList * AttemptLockDosList(
         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tries to get a lock on some of the dos lists. If all went
     well a handle is returned that can be used for FindDosEntry().
     Don't try to busy wait until the lock can be granted - use
     LockDosList() instead.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     flags  --  what lists to lock


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Handle to the dos list or NULL. This is not a direct pointer
     to the first list element but to a pseudo element instead.



ChangeMode
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL ChangeMode(
         ULONG type,
         BPTR object,
         ULONG newmode
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Try to change the mode used by a lock or filehandle.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     type    - CHANGE_FH or CHANGE_LOCK.
     object  - Filehandle or lock.
     newmode - New mode (see <dos/dos.h>).


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 if all went well, otherwise 0. IoErr() gives additional
     information in the latter case.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Since filehandles and locks are identical under AROS the type
     argument is ignored.



CheckSignal
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG CheckSignal(
         LONG mask
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Checks the current task to see if any of the signals specified in
     the mask have been set. The mask of all signals which were set is
     returned. The signals specified in the mask will be cleared.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     mask - The signal mask to check.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The mask of all signals which were set.



Cli
===

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct CommandLineInterface * Cli(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Returns a pointer to the CLI structure of the current process.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to CLI structure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Do not use this function to test if the process was started from
     the shell. Check pr_CLI instead.



CliInitNewcli
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR CliInitNewcli(
         struct DosPacket * dp
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Set up a process to be a shell using a startup packet.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 packet  --  startup arguments passed as a packet


Notes
~~~~~
::


 This function is obsolete as AROS don't use packets. There is no need
 for this function as functionality is added in other places to deal
 with things taken care of by this function. Furthermore, the Amiga
 startup packet interface was a pile of crap.

 CliInitRun()



CliInitRun
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 IPTR CliInitRun(
         struct DosPacket * dp
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Set up a process to be a shell.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 dp  --  startup arguments specified as a packet


Notes
~~~~~
::


 This function is obsolete for the same reasons as CliInitNewCli()
 and should not be used.


See also
~~~~~~~~
::


 CliInitNewCli()



Close
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL Close(
         BPTR file
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Close a filehandle opened with Open(). If the file was used
     with buffered I/O the final write may fail and thus Close()
     return an error. The file is closed in any case.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file  --  filehandle


Result
~~~~~~
::

     0 if there was an error. != 0 on success.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is identical to UnLock().



CompareDates
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG CompareDates(
         const struct DateStamp * date1,
         const struct DateStamp * date2
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Compares two dates.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     date1, date2 - The two dates to compare.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     < 0 if date1 is later than date2, == 0 if they are equal or > 0 
     if date2 is later than date1.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This is NOT the same ordering as strcmp() !



CreateDir
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BPTR CreateDir(
         CONST_STRPTR name
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Creates a new directory under the given name. If all went an
     exclusive lock on the new diretory is returned.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name  -- NUL terminated name.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Exclusive lock to the new directory or 0 if couldn't be created.
     IoErr() gives additional information in that case.



CreateNewProc
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Process * CreateNewProc(
         struct TagItem * tags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a new process using the tagitem array.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     tags - information on the new process.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the new process or NULL on error.



CreateProc
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct MsgPort * CreateProc(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         LONG pri,
         BPTR segList,
         LONG stackSize
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     CreateProc() will create a new process (a process is a superset
     of an exec Task), with the name 'name' and the priority 'pri'.

     You should pass a segList as returned by LoadSeg() (or similar)
     in the 'segList' parameter, and specify the stack size in
     'stackSize'.

     You should really use CreateNewProc() rather than this function
     as it is much more flexible.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name        --   Name of the new process.
     pri         --   Starting priority.
     segList     --   BCPL pointer to a seglist.
     stackSize   --   The size of the initial process stack.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the pr_MsgPort in the Process structure. Will
     return NULL on failure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This will not free the seglist when the process finishes.

     This does not return a pointer to the Process structure, but
     rather the MsgPort structure contained within it. You can
     get the real Process structure by:

     struct Process *pr;
     struct MsgPort *mp;

     mp = CreateProc(...);
     pr = (struct Process *)((struct Task *)mp - 1);

     // Shouldn't use mp after this point

CurrentDir
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BPTR CurrentDir(
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Sets a new directory as the current directory. Returns the old one.
     0 is valid in both cases and represents the boot filesystem.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     lock - Lock for the new current directory.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Old current directory.



DateStamp
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct DateStamp * DateStamp(
         struct DateStamp * date
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Fills the structure with the current time. Time is measured from
     Jan 1, 1978.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     date - The structure to fill.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     date->ds_Days is filled with the days from Jan 1, 1978.
     date->ds_Minute is filled with the number of minutes elapsed in the
     day. date->ds_Tick is the number of ticks elapsed in the current
     minute. A tick happens 50 times a second. DateStamp() ensures that
     the day and minute are consistent. All three elements are zero if
     the date is unset.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The original function could only return even multiples of 50 ticks.



DateToStr
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL DateToStr(
         struct DateTime * datetime
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     DateToStr converts an AmigaDOS DateStamp to a human
     readable ASCII string as requested by your settings in the
     DateTime structure.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     DateTime - a pointer to an initialized DateTime structure. The
                DateTime structure should be initialized as follows:

             dat_Stamp: The datestamp to convert to ascii

             dat_Format: How to convert the datestamp into
                     dat_StrDate. Can be any of the following:

                 FORMAT_DOS: AmigaDOS format (dd-mmm-yy). This
                     is the default if you specify something other
                     than any entry in this list.

                 FORMAT_INT: International format (yy-mmm-dd).

                 FORMAT_USA: American format (mm-dd-yy).

                 FORMAT_CDN: Canadian format (dd-mm-yy).

                 FORMAT_DEF default format for locale.


             dat_Flags: Modifies dat_Format. The only flag
                     used by this function is DTF_SUBST. If set, then
                     a string like "Today" or "Monday" is generated
                     instead of the normal format if possible.

             dat_StrDay: Pointer to a buffer to receive the day of
                     the week string. (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). If null,
                     this string will not be generated.

             dat_StrDate: Pointer to a buffer to receive the date
                     string, in the format requested by dat_Format,
                     subject to possible modifications by DTF_SUBST. If
                     null, this string will not be generated.

             dat_StrTime: Pointer to a buffer to receive the time
                     of day string. If NULL, this will not be generated.



Result
~~~~~~
::

     A zero return indicates that the DateStamp was invalid, and could
     not be converted.  Non-zero indicates that the call succeeded.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     See below.


See also
~~~~~~~~
::

     DateStamp(), StrtoDate()



Delay
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void Delay(
         ULONG timeout
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Waits for at least the time specified as timeout.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     timeout - the minimum time to wait in ticks (1/50 seconds)



DeleteFile
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL DeleteFile(
         CONST_STRPTR name
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tries to delete a file or directory by a given name.
     May fail if the file is in use or protected from deletion.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name       - NUL terminated name.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 if the file is gone, 0 if is still there.
     IoErr() gives additional information in that case.



DeleteVar
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG DeleteVar(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Deletes a local or environment variable.

     The default is to delete a local variable if one was found,
     or to delete a global environmental variable otherwise.

     A global environmental variable will only be deleted for the
     type LV_VAR.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name    -   the name of the variable to delete. Note that variable
                 names follow the same syntax and semantics as filesystem
                 names.

     flags   -   A combination of the type of variable (low 8 bits), and
                 flags to control the behaviour of this routine.
                 Currently defined flags:

                 GVF_LOCAL_ONLY  - delete a local variable.
                 GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY - delete a global environmental variable.



Result
~~~~~~
::

     If non-zero, the variable was deleted successfully,
     DOSFALSE otherwise.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     When the GVF_SAVE_VAR flag is set, and only one of the global
     variable pair could be deleted (either the in memory or on disk
     variable), DOSFALSE will be returned.



DeviceProc
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct Device * DeviceProc(
         CONST_STRPTR name
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     DeviceProc() is an obsolete function that returns the Process
     responsible for a DOS device. It has been updated to return a
     new filesystem device.

     DeviceProc() will fail if you ask for the Process of a device
     created with AssignPath() as there is no process to return.
     If the device requested is an assign, the IoErr() will contain
     the Lock to the directory (the function will return the device
     on which the lock is set).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - The name of the DOS device, without the ':'.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Either a pointer to the Device structure, or NULL.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     You should really use GetDeviceProc() as this function caters
     for all possible device types.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Does not support late- and non-bound assigns, or multiple
     path assigns very well.

~~~~~~~~
::

     GetDeviceProc(), FreeDeviceProc().



DisplayError
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG DisplayError(
         CONST_STRPTR formatStr,
         ULONG flags,
         APTR args
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Displays an error message to and gets response from a user.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     formatStr   --  printf-style formatted string
     flags       --  arguments to EasyRequestArgs()
     args        --  arguments to 'formatStr'


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Nothing


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This is a PRIVATE dos function.



DoPkt
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG DoPkt(
         struct MsgPort * port,
         LONG action,
         LONG arg1,
         LONG arg2,
         LONG arg3,
         LONG arg4,
         LONG arg5
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Send a dos packet to a filesystem and wait for the action to complete.


Notes
~~~~~
::


 Callable from a task.

 This function should NOT be used; it's only here for AmigaOS compatibility.



DupLock
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BPTR DupLock(
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Clone a lock on a file or directory. This will only work on shared
     locks.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     lock - Old lock.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The new lock or NULL in case of an error. IoErr() will give additional
     information in that case.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is identical to DupLockFromFH().



EndNotify
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void EndNotify(
         struct NotifyRequest * notify
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 End a notification (quit notifying for a request previously sent with
 StartNotify()).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 notify  --  NotifyRequest used with StartNotify()


See also
~~~~~~~~
::


 StartNotify()



Error
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BPTR Error(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Returns the current error stream or 0 if there is no current
     input stream.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Error stream handle.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function is AROS specific



ErrorReport
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL ErrorReport(
         LONG code,
         LONG type,
         ULONG arg1,
         struct MsgPort * device
 );

Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 code    --  The error to put up the requester for
 type    --  Type of request

             REPORT_LOCK    --  arg1 is a lock (BPTR).
             REPORT_FH      --  arg1 is a filehandle (BPTR).
             REPORT_VOLUME  --  arg1 is a volumenode (C pointer).
             REPORT_INSERT  --  arg1 is the string for the volumename

 arg1    --  Argument according to type (see above)
 device  --  Optional handler task address (obsolete!)


Notes
~~~~~
::


 Locks and filehandles are the same in AROS so there is redundancy in
 the parameters. Furthermore, the 'device' argument is not cared about
 as AROS don't build filesystems via handlers.



ExAll
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL ExAll(
         BPTR lock,
         struct ExAllData * buffer,
         LONG size,
         LONG data,
         struct ExAllControl * control
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Examine an entire directory.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 lock     --  lock on the directory to be examined
 buffer   --  buffer for the data that is returned (must be aligned)
              which is filled with (partial) ExAllData structures

Result
~~~~~~
::


 An indicator of if ExAll() is done. If FALSE is returned, either ExAll()
 has completed in which case IoErr() is ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES or an
 error occurred. If a non-zero value is returned ExAll() must be called
 again until it returns FALSE.


Notes
~~~~~
::

 size     --  size of 'buffer' in bytes
 type     --  type of the data to be returned
 control  --  a control structure allocated by AllocDosObject()

 
 The following information is essential information on the ExAllData
 structure:

 ead_type :

ExAllEnd
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void ExAllEnd(
         BPTR lock,
         struct ExAllData * buffer,
         LONG size,
         LONG data,
         struct ExAllControl * control
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Stop an ExAll() operation before returning ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 The inputs should correspond to the inputs for the ExAll() function.

 lock     --  lock on the directory that is being examined
 buffer   --  buffer for data returned
 size     --  size of 'buffer' in bytes
 type     --  type of data to be returned
 control  --  control data structure


Notes
~~~~~
::


 The control data structure must have been allocated with AllocDosObject().

::


 ExAll(), AllocDosObject()



ExNext
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL ExNext(
         BPTR lock,
         struct FileInfoBlock * fileInfoBlock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Examine the next entry in a directory.
     

Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 lock  --  lock on the direcory the contents of which to examine
 fib   --  a FileInfoBlock previously initialized by Examine()
           (or used before with ExNext())


Result
~~~~~~
::


 success  --  a boolean telling whether the operation was successful
              or not. A failure occurs also if there is no "next" entry in
              the directory. Then IoErr() equals ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES.


Example
~~~~~~~
::


 To examine a directory, do the following:

 1.  Pass a lock on the directory and a FileInfoBlock (allocated by
     AllocDosObject()) to Examine().
 2.  Pass the same parameters to ExNext().
 3.  Do something with the FileInfoBlock returned.
 4.  Call ExNext() repeatedly until it returns FALSE and use the
     information you are provided. When ExNext returns FALSE, check IoErr()
     to make sure that there was no real failure (ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES).


Notes
~~~~~
::


 If scanning a filesystem tree recursively, you'll need to allocated a
 new FilInfoBlock for each directory level.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     At the moment it is necessary that the lock passed to this
     function is a directory(!!) that has previously been 
     assigned (i.e. assign env: env).

Examine
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL Examine(

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Fill in a FileInfoBlock structure concerning a file or directory 
 associated with a particular lock.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 lock  --  lock to examine
 fib   --  FileInfoBlock where the result of the examination is stored


Result
~~~~~~
::


 A boolean telling whether the operation was successful or not.


Notes
~~~~~
::


 FileInfoBlocks should be allocated with AllocDosObject(). You may make
 a copy of the FileInfoBlock but, however, this copy may NOT be passed
 to ExNext()!

Execute
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG Execute(
         STRPTR string,
         BPTR input,
         BPTR output
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Execute a CLI command specified in 'string'. This string may contain
 features you may use on the shell commandline like redirection using >,
 < or >>. Execute() doesn't return until the command(s) that should be
 executed are finished.
     If 'input' is not NULL, more commands will be read from this stream
 until end of file is reached. 'output' will be used as the output stream
 of the commands (if output is not redirected). If 'output' is NULL the
 current window is used for output -- note that programs run from the
 Workbench doesn't normally have a current window.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 string  --  pointer to a NULL-terminated string with commands
             (may be NULL)
 input   --  stream to use as input (may be NULL)
 output  --  stream to use as output (may be NULL)

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get a character from a buffered file. Buffered I/O is more efficient
     for small amounts of data but less for big chunks. You have to
     use Flush() between buffered and non-buffered I/O or you'll
     clutter your I/O stream.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

         ULONG buflen
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read until NEWLINE (\n), EOF is encountered or buflen-1
     characters have been read. If a NEWLINE is read, it will
     be the last character in the buffer. The buffer will always
     be \0-terminated.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     fh - Read buffered from this filehandle

::

 This routine writes an unformatted string to the filehandle.  No
 newline is appended to the string.  This routine is buffered.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file   - Filehandle to write to.
     string - String to write.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     0 if all went well or EOF in case of an error.

FindDosEntry
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct DosList * FindDosEntry(
         struct DosList * dlist,
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Looks for the next dos list entry with the right name. The list
     must be locked for this. There may be not more than one device
     or assign node of the same name. There are no restrictions on
     volume nodes.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dlist - the value given by LockDosList() or the last call to
             FindDosEntry().
     name  - logical device name without colon. Case insensitive.
     flags - the same flags as given to LockDosList() or a subset
             of them.

     name            - Name of the segment to search for.
     seg             - Start search from this point.
     system          - Search for a system segment.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Will return the segment structure if a match is found, otherwise
     will return NULL.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     FindSegment() does no locking of the segment list. You should 
     lock yourself. FindSegment() also does not increment the value
     of the seg_UC field. If the value of seg_UC > 0, you MUST 
     perform user counting in order to prevent the segment from being
     unloaded.

     seek back to the expected position.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file - filehandle


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 on success, 0 on error. IoErr() gives additional information

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     FreeArgs() will clean up after a call to ReadArgs(). If the
     RDArgs structure was allocated by the system in a call to 
     ReadArgs(), then it will be freed. If however, you allocated
     the RDArgs structure with AllocDosObject(), then you will
     have to free it yourself with FreeDosObject().


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     args            - The data used by ReadArgs(). May be NULL,
                       in which case, FreeArgs() does nothing.

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Return the console handler for the current Process. The return
     type depends upon whether AROS is running binary compatible.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the console handler, or NULL if none is set.

GetDeviceProc
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct DevProc * GetDeviceProc(
         STRPTR name,
         struct DevProc * dp
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     GetDeviceProc() will search for the filesystem handler which
     you should send a command to for a specific path.

     By calling GetDeviceProc() multiple times, the caller will
     be able to handle multi-assign paths.

     The first call to GetDeviceProc() should have the |dp| parameter
     as NULL.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name            - Name of the object to find.
     dp              - Previous result of GetDeviceProc() or NULL.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a DevProc structure containing the information
     required to send a command to a filesystem.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Currently doesn't return dvp_DevNode for locks which are
     relative to "PROGDIR:", ":", or the current directory.

     I'm working on it though...

::

     This function will return the shared lock on the directory that
     the current process was loaded from. You can use this to help
     you find data files which were supplied with your program.

     A NULL return is possible, which means that you may be running
     from the Resident list.

     You should NOT under any circumstance UnLock() this lock.

     into the buffer. If the buffer is too small the name is truncated,
     and a failure is returned. If the current process doesn't have
     a CLI structure, a 0 length string is put into the buffer and a
     failure is returned.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buf - Buffer for the name.
     len - Size of the buffer in bytes.


Result

GetVar
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG GetVar(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         STRPTR buffer,
         LONG size,
         LONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will return the value of a local or environmental
     variable in the supplied buffer.

     It is advised to only use ASCII characters with a variable, but
     this is not required.

     If GVF_BINARY_VAR is not specified, this function will stop putting
     characters into the destination buffer when a '\n' is hit, or the
     end of the buffer is reached. Otherwise it will complete fill the
     buffer.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name    -   the name of the variable you want.
     buffer  -   Space to store the returned variable.
     size    -   Length of the buffer in bytes.
     flags   -   A combination of the type of variable to get (lower
                 8 bits) and flags that control the value of this
                 function. Current flags are:

                 GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY    - only tries to get a global variable.
                 GVF_LOCAL_ONLY     - only tries to get a local variable.
                 GVF_BINARY_VAR     - do not stop at a '\n' character.
                 GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM - no NULL termination. This only
                                      applies to GVF_BINARY_VAR.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Will return the number of characters put in the buffer, or -1
     if the variable is not defined. The '\n' character if it exists
     will not be placed in the buffer.

     If the value would overflow the user buffer, then the number of
     characters copied into the buffer will be returned and the buffer
     truncated.The buffer will be NULL terminated unless
     GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM is set.

     IoErr() will contain either:
       ERROR_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND
           if the variable is not defined.
       ERROR_BAD_NUMBER
           if the size of the buffer is 0.
       the total length of the variable
           otherwise.

         ULONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Waits until the desired dos lists are free then gets a lock on them.

     at once - do not try to get a lock on one of them then on another.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     flags - what lists to lock


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Handle to the dos list. This is not a direct pointer
     to the first list element but to a pseudo element instead.

 timeout   --  maximum number of ticks to wait for a lock to be ready


Result
~~~~~~
::


 Success/failure indication. In case of a success, all the record locks
 are locked. In case of failure, no record locks are locked.


Notes

::

     MakeLink() will create a link between two files or directories.
     A link is a filesystem object that refers to another file.

     A soft link refers to another file by name, and is resolved by
     the filesystem and the caller. Soft links are not restricted to
     the same volume. The |dest| argument is a NUL terminated pathname
     to the pre-existing object. Soft links can be used on directories.

     A hard link refers to another file by the location on a disk, and
     is resolved by the filesystem. Hard links are restricted to files
     on the same volume. The |dest| argument is a lock on another file.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - The name of the link to create
     dest - If 'soft' is TRUE this must be a filename, if it is FALSE a BPTR
            pointing to the file to be hard-linked must be provided
     soft - TRUE, if a soft-link is to be created, FALSE for an hard-link


Result
~~~~~~
::

     boolean - DOSTRUE or DOSFALSE. On error, IoErr() will contain more
     information.

     MatchFirst() initializes the AnchorPath structure for you but you
     must initilize the following fields: ap_Flags, ap_Strlen, ap_BreakBits
     and ap_FoundBreak. The first call to MatchFirst() also passes you
     the first matching file which you can examine in ap_Info and the directory
     the files is in in ap_Current->an_Lock. After the first call to
     MatchFirst() call MatchNext().
     The search begins whereever the current directory is set to. See
     CurrentDir();

ParentDir
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BPTR ParentDir(
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Returns a lock to the parent directory of the supplied lock.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     lock - Lock to get parent directory of.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Returns a lock to the parent directory or NULL, in which case the 
     supplied lock has no parent directory (because it is the root 
     directory) or an error occured. IoErr() returns 0 in the former case 
     and a different value on error.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Locks get via ParentDir() are currently never unlocked! Use this 
     function with care.

ParsePattern
============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG ParsePattern(
         STRPTR Source,
         STRPTR Dest,
         LONG DestLength
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Takes a pattern containing wildcards and transforms it into some
     intermediate representation for use with the MatchPattern() function.
     The intermediate representation is longer but generally a buffer
     size of 2*(strlen(Source)+1) is enough. Nevertheless you should check
     the returncode to be sure that everything went fine.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     Source     - Pattern describing the kind of strings that match.
                  Possible tokens are:
                  #x     - The following character or item is repeaded 0 or
                           more times.
                  ?      - Item matching a single non-NUL character.
                  a|b|c  - Matches one of multiple strings.
                  ~x     - This item matches if the item x doesn't match.
                  (a)    - Parens
                  [a-z]  - Matches a single character out of the set.
                  [~a-z] - Matches a single non-NUL character not in the set.
                  'c     - Escapes the following character.
                  *      - Same as #?, but optional.
     Dest       - Buffer for the destination.
     DestLength - Size of the buffer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

      1 - There are wildcards in the pattern (it might match more than
          one string).
      0 - No wildcards in it, all went fine.
     -1 - An error happened. IoErr() gives additional information in
          that case.



ParsePatternNoCase
==================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG ParsePatternNoCase(
         STRPTR Source,
         STRPTR Dest,
         LONG DestLength
 );

Function

::

     Returns a pointer to the character after the last
     directory in path (see examples).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     path - Search this path.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a character in path.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     PathPart("xxx:yyy/zzz/qqq") would return a pointer to the last '/'.
     PathPart("xxx:yyy") would return a pointer to the first 'y').



PrintFault
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL PrintFault(
         LONG code,
         STRPTR header
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Prints the header and the text associated with the error code to
     the console (buffered), then sets the value returned by IoErr() to
     the error code given.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     code    --  Error code.
     header  --  Text to print before the error message. This may be NULL
                 in which case only the error message is printed.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0 if all went well. 0 on failure.

======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG PutStr(
         CONST_STRPTR string
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This routine writes an unformatted string to the default output.  No 
     newline is appended to the string and any error is returned.  This
     routine is buffered.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     str   - Null-terminated string to be written to default output


Result
~~~~~~
::

     error - 0 for success, -1 for any error.

Read
====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG Read(
         BPTR file,
         APTR buffer,
         LONG length
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read some data from a given file. The request is directly
     given to the filesystem - no buffering is involved. For
     small amounts of data it's probably better to use the
     buffered I/O routines.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file   - filehandle
     buffer - pointer to buffer for the data
     length - number of bytes to read. The filesystem is
              advised to try to fulfill the request as good
              as possible.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The number of bytes actually read, 0 if the end of the
     file was reached, -1 if an error happened. IoErr() will
     give additional information in that case.



ReadArgs
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct RDArgs * ReadArgs(
         CONST_STRPTR template,
         IPTR * array,
         struct RDArgs * rdargs
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Parses the commandline, a given string or Input() and fills
     an argument array according to the options template given.
     The array must be initialized to the wanted defaults before
     each call to ReadArgs(). If the rdargs argument is NULL
     ReadArgs() tries to parse the commandline and continues
     on the input channel if it just consists of a single '?',
     prompting the user for input.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     template - Template string. The template string is given as
                a number of options separated by ',' and modified

Result
~~~~~~
::

     A handle for the memory allocated by ReadArgs(). Must be freed
     with FreeArgs() later.


See also
~~~~~~~~
::

     FreeArgs(), Input()



ReadItem
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG ReadItem(
         STRPTR buffer,
         LONG maxchars,
         struct CSource * input
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read an item from a given character source. Items are words
     or quoted strings seperated by whitespace or '=' just like on
     the commandline. The seperator is unread and the read string
     is terminated by a NUL character.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buffer   - Buffer to be filled.
     maxchars - Size of the buffer. Must be at least 1 (for the terminator).
     input    - A ready to use CSource structure or NULL which means
                "read from the input stream".


Result
~~~~~~
::

     One of ITEM_UNQUOTED - Normal word read.
            ITEM_QUOTED   - Quoted string read.
            ITEM_NOTHING  - End of line found. Nothing read.
            ITEM_EQUAL    - '=' read. Buffer is empty.
            ITEM_ERROR    - An error happened. IoErr() gives additional
                            information in that case.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This function handles conversion of '**', '*"', etc inside quotes.



ReadLink
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG ReadLink(
         struct MsgPort * port,
         BPTR lock,
         STRPTR path,
         STRPTR buffer,
         ULONG size
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Read the filename referred to by the soft-linked object contained
     in |path| (relative to the lock |lock|) into the buffer |buffer|.
     The variable |path| should contain the name of the object that
     caused the original OBJECT_IS_SOFT_LINK error.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     port            - The handler to send the request to.
     lock            - Object that |path| is relative to.
     path            - Name of the object that caused the error.
     buffer          - Buffer to fill with resolved filename.
     size            - Length of the buffer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0    success
     == 0    failure, see IoErr() for more information.

~~~~~~~~
::

     MakeLink()



Relabel
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG Relabel(
         CONST_STRPTR drive,
         CONST_STRPTR newname
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Change names of a volume.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 drive    --  The name of the device to rename (including the ':').
 newname  --  The new name for the device (without the ':').


Result
~~~~~~
::


 A boolean telling whether the name change was successful or not.



RemAssignList
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG RemAssignList(
         STRPTR name,
         BPTR lock
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Remove an entry from a multi-dir assign. The entry removed will be
     the first one that the SameLock() function called on the 'lock'
     parameter returns that they belong to the same object.

     The entry for this lock will be remove from the lock, and the
     lock for the entry in the list will be unlocked.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name    -   Name of the device to remove lock from. This should
                 not contain the trailing ':'.
     lock    -   Lock on the object to remove from the list.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     success -   Have we actually succeeded


Bugs
~~~~
::

     If this is the first lock in a list, this will not set
     dol_Device/dol_Unit correctly. This will be fixed shortly.



RemDosEntry
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG RemDosEntry(
         struct DosList * dlist
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Removes a given dos list entry from the dos list. Automatically
     locks the list for writing.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     dlist - pointer to dos list entry.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     !=0 if all went well, 0 otherwise.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Since anybody who wants to use a device or volume node in the
     dos list has to lock the list, filesystems may be called with
     the dos list locked. So if you want to add a dos list entry
     out of a filesystem don't just wait on the lock but serve all
     incoming requests until the dos list is free instead.



RemSegment
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG RemSegment(
         struct Segment * seg
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Remove the segment seg from the DOS resident command list.

     The segment to be removed should be in the list, and should
     have a usercount of 0. System or internal segment cannot be
     removed (although they can be replaced).


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     seg             - Segment to remove.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0    Segment was removed
     == 0    Segment was not removed (not in list, or not free).

     same volume.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     oldName - Name of the file to rename
     newName - New name of the file to rename


Result
~~~~~~
::

     boolean - DOSTRUE or DOSFALSE. IoErr() provides additional information
     on DOSFALSE.



ReplyPkt
========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 void ReplyPkt(
         struct DosPacket * dp,
         LONG res1,
         LONG res2
 );

Notes
~~~~~
::

   This function is mega-deprecated. Since all AROS drivers
   use IORequests to perform operations the driver will most
   probably not ever use or look at a packet. Also there might 
   not even be a packet at all except for if SendPkt was used.



RunCommand
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG RunCommand(
         BPTR segList,
         ULONG stacksize,

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     RunCommand() will run the command loaded in the |segList| with the
     arguments specified with a new stack of |stacksize| bytes. Note
     that the stacksize may be extended if this is required.

     The return code of the command run will be returned.

     AROS ONLY: RunCommand() automatically computes argsize
     automatically if you pass -1.

     This call will not return until the command has completed.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     segList         - segment of program to run.
     stacksize       - size of the stack to use.
     argptr          - pointer to NULL-terminated arguments.
     argsize         - size of the arguments string.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The return code from the program. See also IoErr().


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Programs expect the arugment string to end with a newline ('\n')
     character (ReadArgs() requires it to work properly).

 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

~~~~~~
::

     handler         - The new console handler for the process.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The address of the old handler.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The use of Task in the name is because historically filesystem

::

     Sets the name for the current program in the CLI structure. If the
     name doesn't fit the old name is kept and a failure is returned.
     If the current process doesn't have a CLI structure this function
     does nothing.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name  --  Name for the current program.


Result

SetProtection
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL SetProtection(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         ULONG protect
 );

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name    - name of the file
     protect - new protection bits


Result

::

     != 0 if all went well, 0 else. IoErr() gives additional
     information in that case.



SetVBuf
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG SetVBuf(
         BPTR file,
         STRPTR buff,
         LONG type,
         LONG size
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Changes the buffering modes and buffer size for a filehandle.
     With buff == NULL, the current buffer will be deallocated and a
     new one of (approximately) size will be allocated.  If buffer is
     non-NULL, it will be used for buffering and must be at least
     max(size,208) bytes long, and MUST be longword aligned.  If size
     is -1, then only the buffering mode will be changed.
 

Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file - Filehandle
     buff - buffer pointer for buffered I/O or NULL.
     type - buffering mode (see <dos/stdio.h>)
     size - size of buffer for buffered I/O (sizes less than 208 bytes
            will be rounded up to 208), or -1.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     0 if operation succeeded. 



SetVar
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL SetVar(
         CONST_STRPTR name,
         CONST_STRPTR buffer,
         LONG size,
         LONG flags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     This function will set a local of environmental variable. Although
     it is recommended that you only use ASCII strings within variables,
     this is not actually required.

     Variable names are not case sensitive.

     SetVar() for an already existing variable changes the variable's
     value to "buffer".


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name        -   The name of the variable to set.
     buffer      -   The actual data of the variable.
     size        -   The size of the data in the buffer.
     flags       -   Combination of the type of variable to set (lower
                     8 bits of the value), and various flags which control
                     this function. Flags defined are:

                     GVF_LOCAL_ONLY  -   set a local variable only,
                     GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY -   set a global environmental
                                         variable only.
                     GVF_SAVE_VAR    -   If GVF_GLOBAL_ONLY is set, then
                                         this flag will cause SetVar() to
                                         save the variable to ENVARC: as well
                                         as to ENV:.
                     GVF_BINARY_VAR and GVF_DONT_NULL_TERM are stored in
                     the lv_Flags field for local variables, but not
                     used otherwise by SetVar().

                     Note the default is to set a local environmental
                     variable.

                     The following variable types are defined:
                     LV_VAR          - local environment variable
                     LV_ALIAS        - shell alias
                     LVF_IGNORE      - internal shell use

                     LV_VAR and LV_ALIAS should be treated as
                     "exclusive or".



Result
~~~~~~
::

     Zero if this function failed, non-zero otherwise.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     It is possible to have two variables with the same name as
     long as they have different types.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Only type LV_VAR can be made global.

     If you set GVF_SAVE_VAR, and this function returns failure, the
     variable may have still been set in ENV:.

SplitName
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG SplitName(
         STRPTR name,
         ULONG seperator,
         STRPTR buf,
         LONG oldpos,
         LONG size
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Split a path into parts at the position of seperator.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     name - Split this path
     seperator - Split it at this seperator
     buf - Copy the current part into this buffer
     oldpos - Begin at this place with the search for seperator.
             If you call this function for the first time, set it
             to 0.
     size - The size of the buffer. If the current part of the
             path is bigger than size-1, only size-1 bytes will
             be copied.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The next position to continue for the next part or -1 if
     there is no seperator after name+oldpos.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     See below.

 whenever the file (or directory) changes.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 notify  --  a notification request for the file or directory to monitor


Result
~~~~~~
::


 Success/failure indicator.


Notes
~~~~~
::

StrToDate
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL StrToDate(
         struct DateTime * datetime
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Converts a human readable ASCII string into an AmigaDOS
     DateStamp.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     DateTime - a pointer to an initialized DateTime structure.
             The structure should be initialized as follows:

             dat_Stamp: The converted date will be written here

             dat_Format: How to convert the datestamp into
                 dat_StrDate. Can be any of the following:

                 FORMAT_DOS: AmigaDOS format (dd-mmm-yy). This
                         is the default if you specify something other
                         than any entry in this list.

                 FORMAT_INT: International format (yy-mmm-dd).

                 FORMAT_USA: American format (mm-dd-yy).

                 FORMAT_CDN: Canadian format (dd-mm-yy).

                 FORMAT_DEF: default format for locale.


             dat_Flags: Modifies dat_Format. The only flag
                     used by this function is DTF_FUTURE. If set, then
                     a string like "Monday" refers to the next monday.
                     Otherwise it refers to the last monday.

             dat_StrDay: Ignored.

             dat_StrDate: Pointer to valid string representing the
                     date. This can be a "DTF_SUBST" style string such
                     as "Today" "Tomorrow" "Monday", or it may be a
                     string as specified by the dat_Format byte. This
                     will be converted to the ds_Days portion of the
                     DateStamp. If this pointer is NULL,
                     DateStamp->ds_Days will not be affected.

             dat_StrTime: Pointer to a buffer which contains the
                     time in the ASCII format hh:mm:ss. This will be
                     converted to the ds_Minutes and ds_Ticks portions
                     of the DateStamp.  If this pointer is NULL,
                     ds_Minutes and ds_Ticks will be unchanged.



Result
~~~~~~
::

     A zero return indicates that a conversion could not be performed. A
     non-zero return indicates that the DateTime.dat_Stamp variable
     contains the converted values.

StrToLong
=========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG StrToLong(
         CONST_STRPTR string,
         LONG * value
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Convert a string to a long number.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     string - The value to convert
     value - The result is returned here


Result
~~~~~~
::

     How many characters in the string were considered when it was
     converted or -1 if no valid number could be found.


Example
~~~~~~~
::

     // Valid number are: 5, -1, +3, +0007, etc.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The routine doesn't check if the number if too large.



SystemTagList
=============

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG SystemTagList(
         CONST_STRPTR command,
         struct TagItem * tags
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Execute a command via a shell. As defaults, the process will use the
 current Input() and Output(), and the current directory as well as the
 path will be inherited from your process. If no path is specified, this
 path will be used to find the command.
     Normally, the boot shell is used but other shells may be specified
 via tags. The tags are passed through to CreateNewProc() except those
 who conflict with SystemTagList(). Currently, these are

     NP_Seglist
     NP_FreeSeglist
     NP_Entry
     NP_Input
     NP_Error
     NP_Output
     NP_CloseInput
     NP_CloseOutput
     NP_CloseError
     NP_HomeDir
     NP_Cli
     NP_Arguments
     NP_Synchrounous
     NP_UserData



Inputs
~~~~~~
::


 command  --  program and arguments as a string
 tags     --  see <dos/dostags.h>. Note that both SystemTagList() tags and
              tags for CreateNewProc() may be passed.


Result
~~~~~~
::


 The return code of the command executed or -1 or if the command could
 not run because the shell couldn't be created. If the command is not
 found, the shell will return an error code, usually RETURN_ERROR.


Notes
~~~~~
::


 You must close the input and output filehandles yourself (if needed)
 after System() returns if they were specified via SYS_Input or
 SYS_Output (also, see below).
     You may NOT use the same filehandle for both SYS_Input and SYS_Output.
 If you want them to be the same CON: window, set SYS_Input to a filehandle
 on the CON: window and set SYS_Output to NULL. Then the shell will
 automatically set the output by opening CONSOLE: on that handler.
     If you specified SYS_Asynch, both the input and the output filehandles
 will be closed when the command is finished (even if this was your Input()
 and Output().

UnGetC
======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG UnGetC(
         BPTR file,
         LONG character
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Push a character back into a read filehandle. If you've read
     a character from that file you may always push at least 1 character
     back. UnGetC(file,-1) ungets the last character read. This also
     works for EOF.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file      - Filehandle you've read from.
     character - Character to push back or EOF.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     !=0 if all went well, 0 if the character couldn't be pushed back.

WaitForChar
===========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 BOOL WaitForChar(
         BPTR file,
         LONG timeout
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Wait for a character to arrive at a filehandle. The filehandle
     can be either a console handle, or a regular file. For a regular
     file most filesystems will return a character immediately, but
     sometimes (for example a network handler) the character may not
     have arrived.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file            - File to wait for a character on.
     timeout         - Number of microseconds to wait for the character
                       to arrive. A value of 0 says to wait indefinately.

Result
~~~~~~
::

     != 0    if a character arrived before the timeout expired
     == 0    if no character arrived


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Many filesystems do not implement this function.



WaitPkt
=======

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 struct DosPacket * WaitPkt(
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Wait for a packet to arrive at your process' pr_MsgPort. It will call
 pr_PktWait if such a function is installed.


Result
~~~~~~
::


 The packet we received.


Notes
~~~~~
::


 The packet will be released from the port.

 This function should NOT be used. It's there only for AmigaOS
 compatibility.



Write
=====

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG Write(
         BPTR file,
         CONST_APTR buffer,
         LONG length
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Write some data to a given file. The request is directly
     given to the filesystem - no buffering is involved. For
     small amounts of data it's probably better to use the
     buffered I/O routines.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     file   - filehandle
     buffer - pointer to data buffer
     length - number of bytes to write. The filesystem is
              advised to try to fulfill the request as good
              as possible.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The number of bytes actually written, -1 if an error happened.
     IoErr() will give additional information in that case.



WriteChars
==========

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 LONG WriteChars(
         STRPTR buf,
         ULONG buflen
 );

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Writes the contents of the buffer to the current output stream.
     The number of bytes written is returned.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     buf - Buffer to be written.
     buflen - Size of the buffer in bytes.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     The number of bytes written or EOF on failure. IoErr() gives
     additional information in that case.
