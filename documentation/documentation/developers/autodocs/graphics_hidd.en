--background_bitmap--
=====================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     Every display driver should implement at least one bitmap class for displayable
     bitmaps.

     Normally this class doesn't need to have public ID. In order to use it the driver
     should pass class pointer as aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr value to the graphics base class
     in its moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap implementation.

     BitMap base class is in C++ terminology a pure virtual
     baseclass. It will not allocate any bitmap data at all;
     that is up to the subclass to do.

     The main task of the BitMap baseclass is to store some information about the bitmap
     like its size and pixelformat. A pixelformat is an object of private class which
     stores the actual information about the format.

     There are two ways that we can find out the pixfmt in our moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap
     implementation:

     Displayable bitmap -
         The tags will contain a modeid.
         One can use this modeid to get a pointer to an
         already registered pixfmt.

     Non-displayable bitmap -
         The aoHidd_BitMap_StdPixFmt or aoHidd_BitMap_Friend attribute will always be
         passed.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_Align
===================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify number of pixels to align bitmap data width to.

     This attribute can be added in order to enforce alignment needed for example by
     blitting hardware. It will have an impact on default aoHidd_BitMap_BytesPerRow
     value.

     Direct specification of aoHidd_BitMap_BytesPerRow attribute overrides any value
     of this attribute.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Default value of this attribute is 16. This alignment is required by graphics.library
     for AmigaOS(tm) compatibility reasons.

`aoHidd_BitMap_BytesPerRow`_ 

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_BytesPerRow
=========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [ISG], ULONG


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify or query number of bytes per row in the bitmap storage buffer.

     Setting this attribute doesn't actually cause changing buffer layout, just updates
     the information about it. Use this only from within subclasses and only if you
     exactly know why you do this.

     Specifying this attribute during object creation overrides the value calculated
     based on aoHidd_BitMap_Width and aoHidd_BitMap_Align values. Useful for wrapping
     own buffers into bitmap objects, for example, in conjunction with
     aoHidd_ChunkyBM_Buffer.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The returned value includes possible padding needed for alignment.

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_ClassID
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Explicitly specify bitmap's class ID.

     The purpose of this attribute is to let graphics driver base class to select a class
     on which to call OOP_NewObject() in its moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap implementation.

     If neither this attribute nor aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr attribute is provided for
     moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap, graphics base class will do its best in order to find out the
     correct class based on aoHidd_StdPixFmt attribute value or aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr value
     of friend bitmap.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     The pointer to a given class will not be remembered as aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr value.

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr
======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..], OOP_Class *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Explicitly specify bitmap's class pointer.

     This attribute is not actually a bitmap's attribute. Your display driver class can
     supply it to base class' moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap method in order to select a class on
     which to call OOP_NewObject().

     If neither this attribute nor aoHidd_BitMap_ClassID attribute is provided for
     moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap, graphics base class will do its best in order to find out the
     correct class based on aoHidd_StdPixFmt attribute value or friend bitmap.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     If a friend bitmap is given, the new bitmap will have the same class, if your driver
     doesn't override it by supplying explicit class specification (using either
     aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr or aoHidd_BitMap_ClassID attribute).

`aoHidd_BitMap_ClassID`_ CLID_Hidd_Gfx/moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap 

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_ColorMap
======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], OOP_Object *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Return associated colormap (palette) object.

     By default only displayable bitmaps have colormaps. However a colormap can be attached
     to any bitmap using moHidd_BitMap_SetColors or moHidd_BitMap_SetColorMap.

     Note that manual attaching of a colormap to a nondisplayable bitmap may cause undesired
     side-effects on graphics.library behavior. It's better not to do this at all. The system
     knows what it does better than you.

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_Depth
===================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [G.I]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify or query the actual bitmap depth.

     This a convenience attribute to simplify handling planar bitmaps, whose actual depth
     may vary. Default implementation in base class simply returns depth of bitmap's
     pixelformat, and is ignored during initialization. Planar bitmap class returns the
     actual depth here. If your specific bitmap class also operates on bitmaps with variable
     depths, you need to implement this attribute in it.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_Displayable
=========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     The bitmap is displayable. A displayable bitmap is always managed by a display
     driver and must have valid display mode ID specification.

     If this attribute is not supplied during bitmap creation, its value defaults
     to FALSE.



See also
~~~~~~~~

`aoHidd_BitMap_ModeID`_ 

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_FrameBuffer
=========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specifies that the bitmap is a framebuffer bitmap.

     A detailed description of a framebuffer is given in CLID_Hidd_Gfx/moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap
     and in CLID_Hidd_Gfx/moHidd_Gfx_Show documentation.

     Specifying this attribute causes also implicit setting of aoHidd_BitMap_Displayable
     to TRUE.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_Friend
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], OOP_Object *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify a friend bitmap. The bitmap will be allocated so that it
     is optimized for blitting to this bitmap.

     Display drivers may query this attribute and then query friend bitmap
     for anything they want (like pixelformat, mode ID, etc).

     Note that explicit specification of mode ID and/or standard pixelformat
     should override defaults provided by friend bitmap (i.e. actually breaking
     the friendship).



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_GfxHidd
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], OOP_Object *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify display driver object this bitmap was created with.

     Normally the user doesn't have to supply this attribute. Instead you should use
     driver's moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap method in order to create bitmaps. In this case
     aoHidd_BitMap_GfxHidd attribute will be provided by graphics driver base class
     with the correct value.

     It is illegal to manually create bitmap objects with no driver associated.
     graphics.library maintains at least a memory driver for nondisplayable
     bitmaps in system RAM without any acceleration.

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_Height
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [ISG], UWORD


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specifies bitmap height in pixels.
     
     Setting this attribute does not cause actual bitmap resize, just updates the information
     about it. Use this only from within subclasses only if you know what you do. For example
     SDL hosted driver sets it when framebufer changes the resolution.

~~~~~~~~

`aoHidd_BitMap_Width`_ 

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_IsLinearMem
=========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Check if the bitmap provides linear memory access. This means that bitmap's
     pixelbuffer is directly addressable by the CPU.

     Bitmaps with no linear memory may implement moHidd_BitMap_ObtainDirectAccess,
     but this means that this method will rely on mirrored buffer. In such a case
     the user must call moHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect after modifying bitmap's contents.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Used by cybergraphics.library/GetCyberMapAttr() for providing CYBRMATTR_ISLINEARMEM
     value.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     Currently no display drivers implement this attribute despite many native mode
     drivers actually provide linear memory.

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_LeftEdge
======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [.SG]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Controls horizontal position of a scrollable screen bitmap.

     Size of displayable bitmaps may differ from actual screen size. In this case the
     bitmap can be scrolled around the whole display area. If the bitmap is larger than
     the display, only its part can be visible.

     Setting this attribute causes changing left origin point of the bitmap. The value
     of this attribute represents an offset from the physical edge of the display to the
     logical edge of the bitmap. This means that if a large bitmap scrolls to the left in
     order to reveal its right part, the offset will be negative. If the bitmap scrolls
     to the left (possibly revealing another bitmap behind it), the offset will be positive.

     It's up to the display driver to set scroll limits. If the value of the attribute
     becomes unacceptable for any reason, the driver should adjust it and provide the real
     resulting value back.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Implementing screen scrolling does not enforce to implement screen composition, despite
     the composition is really based on scrolling (in case of composition scrolling a bitmap
     off-display is expected to reveal another bitmap behing it instead of empty space).



See also
~~~~~~~~

`aoHidd_BitMap_TopEdge`_ 

----------

aoHidd_BitMap_ModeID
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [ISG], HIDDT_ModeID


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify display mode ID for displayable bitmap.

     A displayable bitmap must have this attribute supplied with valid value. A nondisplayable
     one may miss it, however it may remember it if it was created as a friend of displayable
     one. This way you may create another displayable bitmap as a friend of nondisplayable
     one which in turn is a friend of displayable one.

     This attribute can be set on a framebuffer bitmap. Doing so means an explicit request
     for the driver to change current display mode on the hardware. Dependent parameters
     (width, height and pixelformat) will be automatically adjusted, if not explicitly
     specified in the attributes list.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     If the given ModeID is not supported, the operation causes an error. You can check
     for this by checking return value of OOP_SetAttrs() function. It will be TRUE in
     case of success and FALSE upon failure. In case of failure none of bitmap attributes
     will be changed.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_PixFmt
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], OOP_Object *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify or query pixelformat descriptor object associated with the bitmap.

     Every bitmap has some associated pixelformat object. Pixelformat objects are
     shared data storages, so many bitmaps may refer to the same pixelformat objects.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This attribute is internally specified during bitmap creation, but it's illegal
     to do this for the user. NewBitMap method of graphics driver performs an explicit
     check against this. It's up to graphics base classes to figure out its value.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_PixFmtTags
========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [...]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Private, very obsolete and currently has no function. Considered reserved.



----------

aoHidd_BitMap_StdPixFmt
=======================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..], HIDDT_StdPixFmt


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify standard pixelformat code (one of vHidd_StdPixFmt_... values) for the
     bitmap.

     Values less than num_Hidd_PseudoStdPixFmt are illegal for this attribute.

     Actually the bitmap class itself ignores this attribute. It is processed by
     CLID_Hidd_Gfx/moHidd_Gfx_NewBitMap method in order to look up a corresponding
     pixelformat object in the system's database.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Bitmaps with this attribute set should be created as RAM bitmaps with direct CPU
     access. It is not recommended to replace them with, for example, virtual surfaces on
     hosted AROS. Such bitmaps are expected to be directly addressable and breaking
     this may cause undesired side effects.

aoHidd_BitMap_TopEdge
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [.SG]


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Controls vertical position of a scrollable screen bitmap.

     Size of displayable bitmaps may differ from actual screen size. In this case the
     bitmap can be scrolled around the whole display area. If the bitmap is larger than
     the display, only its part can be visible.

     Setting this attribute causes changing top origin point of the bitmap. The value
     of this attribute represents an offset from the physical edge of the display to the
     logical edge of the bitmap. This means that if a large bitmap scrolls upwards in
     order to reveal its bottom part, the offset will be negative. If the bitmap scrolls
     downdards (possibly revealing another bitmap behind it), the offset will be positive.

     It's up to the display driver to set scroll limits. If the value of the attribute
     becomes unacceptable for any reason, the driver should adjust it and provide the real
     resulting value back.

Synopsis

::

     VOID OOP_DoMethod(OOP_Object *obj, struct pHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect *msg);

     VOID HIDD_BM_UpdateRect(OOP_Object *obj, WORD x, WORD y, WORD width, WORD height);


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Update displayed image of the given rectangle.

     Some drivers (like VGA and VESA) may work not with VRAM directly, but with a mirrored
     copy of it. Usually it is done in case if VRAM reading is slow. This method is called
     by the system after it completes any drawing operation, in order to make sure that
     changes made are visible on the actual screen. If your driver uses mirroring, this method
     should copy the given rectangle (at least) from the mirror buffer to the actual VRAM.

     This method is also called after changing currently visible bitmap (after moHidd_Gfx_Show
     method call) in order to allow the mirroring driver to refresh the screen after current bitmap
     changed. Note that moHidd_Gfx_ShowViewPorts is very different and moHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect
     will not be called if it succeeded!


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     obj    - an object whose image to refresh
     x, y   - A top-left edge of the rectangle to refresh
     width  - Width of the rectangle to refresh
     height - Height of the rectangle to refresh


Result
~~~~~~
::

     None.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This method is called also on offscreen bitmaps. You should track visible state of your bitmap
     and ignore these calls if it's not currently visible on the screen.

--background_graphics--
=======================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     When working with graphics drivers this is the first object you get.
     It allows you to create BitMap and GC (graphics context)
     object. The class' methods must be overidden by hardware-specific
     subclasses where documented to do so.



----------

--display_modes--
=================

Notes
~~~~~
::

     Each display driver object internally stores a database of supported display mode
     IDs. This database is normally managed by base class, the driver does not need to
     reimplement respective methods.

     A display mode ID in AROS is a 32-bit integer value, the same as on AmigaOS(tm).
     However mode ID layout introduced by Commodore does not fit well for RTG systems.
     In order to overcome its limitations, display ID on AROS may have two forms:

     1. A chipset mode ID. These are standard IDs defined by Commodore. You may find
        their definitions in graphics/modeid.h.

     2. AROS RTG mode ID.

     An RTG mode ID is composed of three parts in the form:

     nnnn xx yy

     nnnn - monitor ID. This number is maintained by system libraries. IDs are
            assigned in the order in which drivers are loaded and display hardware is
            found. Drivers do not have to care about this part, and should normally
            mask it out if they for some reason look at mode ID. In order to
            distinguish between chipset mode IDs and RTG mode IDs, order number starts
            not from zero, reserving some space for C= chipset mode IDs (which appear
            to have order numbers from 0x0000 to 0x000A). Currently RTG monitor IDs
            start from 0x0010, however with time this value may change. So don't rely
            on some particular values in RTG IDs. Use cybergraphics.library/IsCyberModeID()
            function if you want to know for sure if the given mode ID belongs to an
            RTG driver.

       xx - A sync object index in driver's mode database.
       yy - A pixelformat object in driver's mode database.

     Normally the driver does not have to care about mode ID decoding. The mode
     database is maintained by base class. The only useful things for the driver are
     sync and pixelformat objects, from which it's possible to get different
     information about the mode. They can be obtained from the base class using
     HIDD_Gfx_GetMode().

     Note that the driver object by itself does not know its monitor ID. Different
     displays are served by different objects, any of which may belong to any class.
     So all driver methods which return mode IDs will set monitor ID to zero. All
     methods that take mode ID as argument are expected to ignore the monitor ID part
     and do not make any assumptions about its value.

aoHidd_Gfx_ActiveCallBack
=========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [.S.], void (*)(APTR userdata, OOP_Object *bitmap)


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Set display activation interrupt handler.

     This handler needs to be called by hosted display driver, if host OS
     windowing system is used for the display and mouse input is handled by the
     host OS.

     This way the driver can tell AROS when a display window has been activated so that
     AROS will be able to switch current display correctly when working in a multi-display
     configuration.

     The function uses C calling convention and needs to be declared as follows:

     void ActivationHandler(APTR userdata, OOP_Object *bitmap);

     Parameters of this function will be:
       userdata - Whatever is specified by aoHidd_Gfx_ActiveCallBackData attribute.
       bitmap   - Currently reserved. Drivers need to set it to NULL.

     The function can be called from within an interrupt, so usual restrictions apply
     to it.

     Set this attribute to NULL in order to disable activation handling.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     When setting the activation callback function, be sure that you set correct
     userdata before you actually set the callback pointer. Otherwise your callback
     can be called with wrong data pointer.

     Only one activation handler can be installed. Installing a new handler replaces
     the previous one.

     Native displays do not need to implement this attribute because there can be
     no external activation events.

aoHidd_Gfx_ActiveCallBackData
=============================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [.S.], APTR


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Set user-defined data pointer for display activation handler.

~~~~~~~~

`aoHidd_Gfx_ActiveCallBack`_ 

----------

aoHidd_Gfx_DefaultGC
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], OOP_Object *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Get a pointer to shared default GC object.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     The returned GC is preset to the following:

       DrawMode = Copy
       FG       = 0
       BG       = 0
       LinePat  = ~0
       ColMask  = ~0

     You must not alter these settings even temporarily, because this GC is shared between
     bitmaps and between different tasks which may perform the rendering into different
     regions of the same bitmap (two windows on one screen, for example). This GC is intended
     to be used for internal copying operations.

aoHidd_Gfx_DMPSLevel
====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [ISG], HIDDT_DPMSLevel


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Gets or sets current DPMS level for driver's display.
     A value can be one of:
         vHidd_Gfx_DPMSLevel_On,
         vHidd_Gfx_DPMSLevel_Standby,
         vHidd_Gfx_DPMSLevel_Suspend,
         vHidd_Gfx_DPMSLevel_Off

     If the driver does not support some state, it's up to the driver what to do.
     Usually it is expected to ignore the request.

     Getting this attribute should return real current state.



----------

aoHidd_Gfx_DriverName
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], STRPTR


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Query CyberGraphX driver name. It is the same name which can be given to
     cybergraphics.library/BestCModeIDTagList() as CYBRBIDTG_BoardName value.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     By default base class returns class name as value of this attribute.
     However this can (and must for some drivers listed in BestCModeIDTagList()
     documentation) be overriden.



----------

aoHidd_Gfx_FrameBufferType
==========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I.G], UBYTE


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specifies fixed framebuffer type used by the driver. The value can be one of the following:

       vHidd_FrameBuffer_None     - the driver does not use framebuffer.
       vHidd_FrameBuffer_Direct   - the driver uses framefuffer which can be accessed
                                    directly for both reads and writes.
       vHidd_FrameBuffer_Mirrored - the driver uses write-only framebuffer.

     This attribute has to be specified during driver object creation. If this is not done,
     the OS will use value of old aoHidd_Gfx_NoFrameBuffer attribute in order to distinguish
     between vHidd_FrameBuffer_Direct (for FALSE) and vHidd_FrameBuffer_None (for TRUE).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     A fixed framebuffer is a special bitmap in a fixed area of video RAM. If the
     framebuffer is used, the driver is expected to copy a new bitmap into it in
     HIDD_Gfx_Show() and optionally copy old bitmap back.

     A framebuffer is needed if the hardware does not have enough VRAM to store many
     bitmaps or does not have capabilities to switch the display between various VRAM
     regions.

     Some hardware suffers from slow VRAM reading. In this case you should use mirrored
     mode. If you use it, the system will hold a bitmap in the memory buffer, and
     update VRAM on demand (hence the name).

     An example of driver using a framebuffer is hosted SDL driver. By design SDL works
     only with single display window, which is considered a framebuffer.

aoHidd_Gfx_HWSpriteTypes
========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Return hardware sprite image types supported by the driver.
     
     The returned value is a combination of the following bit flags:
       vHidd_SpriteType_3Plus1 - color 0 is transparent, 1-3 visible
                                 (Amiga(tm) chipset sprite format)
       vHidd_SpriteType_2Plus1 - color 0 is transparent, color 1 is undefined
                                  (can be whatever, for example clear or inverse),
                                  colors 2-3 visible.
       vHidd_SpriteType_DirectColor - Hi- or truecolor image, or LUT image with own
                                      palette, perhaps with alpha channel


Notes
~~~~~
::

     This attribute should return 0 if the driver does not support hardware mouse sprite
     at all. Software sprite emulation is done by graphics.library.

     Default implementation in the base class is based on aoHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor
     value. This is done for backwards compatibility.



See also
~~~~~~~~

`aoHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor`_ 

----------

aoHidd_Gfx_IsWindowed
=====================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tells if the display driver is using hosted display in host OS' window, and mouse
     input is handled by host OS.

     Windowed displays may send activation events to AROS. This is needed in order to
     correctly handle display switch in a multi-display configuration (which means that
     the user has multiple windows on host OS desktop and can freely switch between them).


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Even in fullscreen mode drivers should still return TRUE if the host OS manages mouse
     input (for example, X11 driver). If mouse input is not managed by the host OS
     (for example, with Linux framebuffer driver), return FALSE.

aoHidd_Gfx_ModeTags
===================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..], struct TagItem *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specify a pointer to a taglist which contains description of display modes
     supported by the driver.

     This attribute is usually appended in moRoot_New method of the display driver
     class.
     
     This attribute is mandatory for the base class, otherwise driver object creation
     fails.
     
     Mode description taglist may contain the following tags:
       - Any sync attributes - these attributes will specify values common for all sync
                               modes
       - Any pixelformat attributes - these attributes will specify values common for
                                      all pixelformat modes
       - aoHidd_Gfx_SyncTags - specifies a pointer to another separate taglist containing
                               attributes for one sync (display) mode. If this tag
                               is not supplied at all, a set of default modes will be
                               generated for the driver.
       - aoHidd_Gfx_PixFmtTags - specifies a pointer to another separate taglist containing
                                 attributes for one pixelformat. This tag must be supplied
                                 at least once, otherwise driver object will fail to create.
     
       aoHidd_Gfx_SyncTags and aoHidd_Gfx_PixFmtTags can be specified multiple times in
       order to associate more than one display mode with the driver. Note that common
       values for sync and pixelformat objects need to be placed in the taglist before
       aoHidd_Gfx_SyncTags and aoHidd_Gfx_PixFmtTags. You may specify them again between
       these tags in order to alter common values.

aoHidd_Gfx_NoFrameBuffer
========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tells whether the driver does not need a framebuffer.

     Since v1.2 this attribute is obsolete. Please use aoHidd_Gfx_FrameBufferType
     in new code.


Notes

::

     Provides FALSE if not implemented in the driver.

aoHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor
===========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [..G], BOOL


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Tells whether the driver supports hardware mouse pointer sprite.

     If the driver provides TRUE value for this attribute, it is expected to implement
     HIDD_Gfx_SetCursorPos(), HIDD_Gfx_SetCursorShape() and HIDD_Gfx_SetCursorVisible()
     methods.

     Mouse pointer counts for one hardware sprite, so if the driver implements also
     HIDD_Gfx_ModeProperties(), it should set NumHWSprites to 1 in order to provide
     valid information about display modes.

     The driver must implement this attribute if it implements HIDD_Gfx_ModeProperties().
     Otherwise it will provide false information in graphics.library/GetDisplayInfoData().
     Base class can determine NumHWSprites based on this attribute value but not vice
     versa.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Default implementation in the base class returns FALSE. This causes the system to
     use software sprite emulation.

     This attribute is obsolete and is used only by AROS graphics.library up to v41.2. In
     new drivers consider implementing aoHidd_Gfx_HWSpriteTypes attribute.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Check if given display mode is supported by the driver.

     Normally any resolution (sync) can be used together with any pixelformat. However
     on some hardware there may be exceptions from this rule. In such a case this
     method should be implemented, and check should be performed.

     The information provided by this method is used in order to exclude unsupported
     modes from the database

     Default implementation in the base class just returns TRUE for all supplied values.

     Note that this method can not be used in order to chech that the given mode is
     really present in the database and it really refers to the given sync and
     pixelformat objects. Use HIDD_Gfx_GetMode() for mode ID validation.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     gfxHidd - A display driver object
     modeID  - A display mode ID
     sync    - A pointer to a sync object associated with this mode
     pixFmt  - A pointer to a pixelformat object associated with this mode


Result

     OOP_Object *HIDD_Gfx_NewBitMap(OOP_Object *gfxHidd, struct TagItem *tagList);


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a bitmap object.

     One graphics driver represents at least one displayable bitmap class.
     Additionally it may represent more classes (for example some old drivers use
     a separate class for nondisplayable bitmaps).

     These classes are private to the driver. In order to be able to use them
     bitmap objects are never created directly. Instead they are created using the
     HIDD_Gfx_NewBitMap() call. An implementation of this method in the driver
     should examine bitmap attributes supplied and make a decision if the bitmap
     should be created using the driver's own class or one of the system classes.

     A typical implementation should pay attention to the following bitmap attributes:
 
     aHIDD_BitMap_ModeID - If this attribute is supplied, the bitmap needs to be
                           either displayable by this driver, or be a friend of a
                           displayable bitmap. A friend bitmap usually repeats the
                           internal layout of its friend so that the driver may
                           perform blitting operations quickly.

     aHIDD_BitMap_Displayable - If this attribute is supplied, the bitmap NEEDS to be
                                displayable by this driver. Usually this means that
                                the bitmap object will contain video hardware state
                                information. This attribute will always be accompanied
                                by aHIDD_BitMap_ModeID.

     aHIDD_BitMap_FrameBuffer - The bitmap needs to be a framebuffer bitmap. A
                                framebuffer bitmap is necessary for some kinds of
                                hardware which have a small fixed amount of video
                                RAM which can hold only one screen at a time. Setting
                                this attribute requires that a valid ModeID be also set.

     aHIDD_BitMap_Friend - If there's no ModeID supplied, you may wish to check class
                           of friend bitmap. This can be useful if your driver uses
                           different classes for displayable and non-displayable bitmaps.
                           By default base class will pick up friend's class and use it
                           for new bitmap if nothing is specified, here you may override
                           this behavior.

     If your driver wants to specify own class for the bitmap being created,
     it should prepend an aoHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr attribute to the supplied taglist
     and pass it to base class. It's not allowed to create bitmap objects directly
     since they need some more extra information which is added by the base class!

     This method must be implemented by your subclass. aHIDD_BitMap_ClassPtr or
     aHIDD_BitMap_ClassID must be provided to the base class for a displayable bitmap!


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     gfxHidd - The graphics driver object that will provide the bitmap.

     tagList - A list of bitmap attributes. See hidd.graphics.bitmap class
               documentation for their descriptions.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     bm - pointer to the newly created bitmap.
 

Notes
~~~~~
::

     Drivers which do not use framebuffer must always specify own class using either
     moHidd_BitMap_ClassPtr or moHidd_BitMap_ClassID attribute. Drivers making use of
     framebuffer may omit this, in this case framebuffer's class will be used for
     displayable bitmaps.

     A GC object is just a data storage. You may create a subclass of GC if
     you wish to, however there's usually no need to. Additionally, this may
     be not future-proof (since GC subclasses can not be interchanged between
     different drivers. Please avoid using custom GCs.


Bugs
~~~~
::

     At the moment subclassing GCs is not supported because some parts of
     the operating system create GC objects directly. It is unclear whether
     subclassing GCs is actually needed.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Create a video overlay object.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     gfxHidd - A graphics driver object on whose display you want to create an overlay.
     tagList - A list of overlay attributes. See overlay class documentation for
               their description.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     Pointer to the newly created overlay object or NULL in case of failure.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Default implementation in the base class always sets VOERR_INVSCRMODE error and
     returns NULL meaning that hardware overlays are not supported. There's no sense
     in software implementation because the software is supposed to handle software
     rendering itself.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Set mouse pointer shape.

     A pointer image is contained in the specified bitmap object. The bitmap object
     may contain a colormap if the system wants to specify own colors for the pointer.
     The supplied colormap will also contain alpha channel values.

     It is up to driver what to do if, for example, alpha channel is not supported by
     the hardware. Or if given bitmap type is not supported (for example truecolor
     bitmap on LUT-only hardware). It is expected that the driver converts bitmap
     data to a more appropriate form in such a case.

     A hotspot is given as an offset from the actual hotspot to the top-left corner
     of the pointer image. It is generally needed only for hosted display drivers
     which utilize host's support for mouse pointer.

     The default implementation in the base class just does nothing. A software mouse
     pointer is implemented in a special layer called fakegfx.hidd inside
     graphics.library. If a software pointer emulation is used, this method will
     never be called.

     OOP_Object *HIDD_Gfx_Show(OOP_Object *gfxHidd, OOP_Object *bitMap, ULONG flags);


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Change currently displayed bitmap on the screen.

     The bitmap object supplied must have been created with aHidd_BitMap_Displayable
     attribute set to TRUE.

     The function's behavior differs a lot depending on whether the driver uses a
     framebuffer or video hardware is able to switch screens itself.

     If the driver uses a framebuffer bitmap, it is supposed to copy the supplied bitmap
     into the framebuffer and return a framebuffer pointer. It also can be asked to
     copy back old framebuffer contents into previous bitmap object. It is driver's
     job to keep track of which bitmap object was displayed last time. This is what
     default implementation does. Note that it is very basic, and even does not support
     changing display resolution. It's not recommended to rely on it in production
     drivers (unless your video hardware supports only one mode).

     If the driver does not use a framebuffer, it is supposed to reprogram the hardware
     here to display an appropriate region of video RAM. Do not call the base class
     in this case, its implementation relies on framebuffer existance and will always
     return NULL which indicates an error.

     It is valid to get NULL value in bitMap parameter. This means that there is
     nothing to display and the screen needs to be blanked out. It is valid for
     non-framebuffer-based driver to return NULL as a reply then. In all other cases
     NULL return value means an error.

     Please avoid returning errors at all. graphics.library/LoadView() has no error
     indication. An error during showing a bitmap would leave the display in
     unpredictable state.

     If the driver does not use a framebuffer, consider using HIDD_Gfx_ShowViewPorts().
     It's more straightforward, flexible and offers support for screen composition.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     gfxHidd - a display driver object, whose display you wish to change.
     bitMap  - a pointer to a bitmap object which needs to be shown or NULL.
     flags   - currently only one flag is defined:

     fHidd_Gfx_Show_CopyBack - Copy back the image data from framebuffer bitmap
                               to old displayed bitmap. Used only if the driver
                               needs a framebuffer.


Result
~~~~~~
::

     A pointer to a currently displayed bitmap object or NULL (read FUNCTION paragraph for
     detailed description)


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Drivers which use mirrored video data buffer do not have to update the display
     immediately in this method. moHidd_BitMap_UpdateRect will be sent to the returned
     bitmap if it's not NULL. Of course display blanking (if NULL bitmap was received)
     needs to be performed immediately.

Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Show one or more bitmaps on the screen.

     It is completely up to the driver how to implement this function. The driver may
     or may not support hardware-assisted screens composition. Bitmaps are sorted
     in the list in descending z-order. The driver is expected to put at least frontmost
     bitmap on display.

     It is valid to get NULL pointer as data parameter. This means that there's
     nothing to show and the screen should go blank.

     Bitmaps display offsets are stored in their aHidd_BitMap_LeftEdge and
     aHidd_BitMap_TopEdge attributes. This function is not expected to modify their
     values somehow. They are assumed to be preserved between calls unless changed
     explicitly by the system.

     If you implement this method, you don't have to implement HIDD_Gfx_Show() because
     it will never be called.

     Note that there is no more error indication - the driver is expected to be
     error-free here.


Inputs
~~~~~~
::

     gfxHidd - a display driver object, whose display you wish to change.
     data    - a singly linked list of bitmap objects to show


Result

::

     Allows to specify or retrieve a raw planar bitmap structure associated with the object.
     Useful for direct access to the bitmap within subclasses, as well as for associating
     an object with already existing BitMap structure.

     It is valid to pass this attribute with a NULL value. In this case the object becomes
     empty and contains no actual bitmap.


Notes
~~~~~
::

     If the object was created with own bitmap data (with no aoHidd_PlanarBM_BitMap specified

~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..], ULONG *


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specifies a pointer to ULONG location where error code will be written.

     This attribute can be used for overlay creation in order to be able to get an
     information about the actual failure reason.

     Resulting error code can be one of VOERR_... values defined in
     cybergraphx/cgxvideo.h:
     
       VOERR_OK          - there was no error
       VOERR_INVSCRMODE  - no (more) hardware overlays are supported on this card
       VOERR_NOOVLMEMORY - there is not enough VRAM to hold overlay data
       VOERR_INVSRCFMT   - given source pixel format is not supported by the card
       VOERR_NOMEMORY    - there is not enough system RAM for internal driver needs

aoHidd_Overlay_SrcFormat
========================

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

     [I..], ULONG


Function
~~~~~~~~
::

     Specifies source data pixel format. The value should be one of SRCFMT_... constants
     defined in cybergraphx/cgxvideo.h:
     
       SRCFMT_YUV16   - 16-but YUV
       SRCFMT_YCbCr16 - 16-bit YCbCr
       SRCFMT_RGB15PC - R5G5B5, little-endian
       SRCFMT_RGB16PC - R5G6B5, little-endian


Notes
~~~~~
::

     Not all formats can be supported by all drivers. Use aoHidd_Overlay_Error attribute
     in order to get an explanation why overlay creation fails.
