Function
~~~~~~~~
::


     Evaluate an integer expression and print the result. The result is
     written to standard output if not the TO switch are used which instead
     prints the result to a file. Using the switch LFORMAT, it is
     possible to direct how to write the result. Numbers prefixed by
     0x or #x are interpreted as hexadecimal and those prefixed by # or 0
     are interpreted as octals. Alphabetical characters are indicated
     by a leading single quotation mark ('), and are evaluated as their
     ASCII equivalent.


Inputs

     VALUE1,
     OP,
     VALUE2      --  The expression to evaluate. The following operators
                     are supported

     TO          --  File to write the result to
     LFORMAT     --  printf-like specification of what to write.
                     The possible swiches are:
                      
                     %x  --  hexadecimal output
                     %o  --  octal output
                     %n  --  decimal output
                     %c  --  character output (the ANSI-character
                             corresponding to the result value)
                             
                     By specifying *n in the LFORMAT string, a newline
                     is output.
