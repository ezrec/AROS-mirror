Synopsis
~~~~~~~~
::

 
 Delete { (name | pattern) } [ALL] [QUIET] [FORCE]


Location
~~~~~~~~
::


     Workbench/c


Function
~~~~~~~~
::


 Deletes files and directories. You may delete several files and directories
 by listing them separately or by using wildcards. To abort a multiple
 delete, press CTRL-C. Delete will notify the user of which files it
 weren't able to delete.
     Delete cannot delete directories which are not empty unless the
 ALL option is used. To suppresss file and directory names from being
 printed while deleted use the QUIET option. If the 'd' protection bit
 is cleared for a file or directory, it may not be deleted unless the
 FORCE option is used.

               deletion


Example
