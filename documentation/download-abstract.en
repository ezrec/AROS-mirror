Distributions
=============

Distributions are preconfigured and tested versions of AROS. They 
contain a lot of useful user applications that don't come with the
main AROS.org binaries and will be of great interest to users. They may
not have the latest core system, but their stability and user friendliness
is much greater than those of the nightly builds. If you are a user interested
in checking what AROS has to offer, use the distributions to get the most
complete AROS experience.
