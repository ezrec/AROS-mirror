Adam Chodorowski took the time to build a nice set of PNG icons, based on the
Gnome "Gorilla" icon set, to show this new AROS feature off. You can also see
the new Wanderer preference program, which right now lets you just change the
backgrounds of the desktop and directory windows, but will later on allow to
customize other of Wanderer's features. 

Also notice that all fonts are antialiased.
