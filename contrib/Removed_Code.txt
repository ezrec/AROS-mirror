----------------------------------------------------------------------------

31 Aug 2013: contrib/freetype1

  Removed because of freetype2 in workbench/libs.

6 Jun 2012: contrib/pack/bzip2

  Removed because we build it from workbench/libs/bz2.

15 Jan 2011: contrib/aminet/dev/c

  Deleted because building it was disabled about a year ago. There was only
  a port of gnu indent which had build problems at that time. Additionally,
  there is another port of gnu indent in contrib/gnu.

30 Dec 2009: contrib/Feelin

  This code was considered obsolete. It was not the recent version and the
  author indicated that it was not developed anymore.

2 Jan 2007: contrib/development/compilers/freepascal

  Removed because it was a quite large paket which didn't work for AROS.
