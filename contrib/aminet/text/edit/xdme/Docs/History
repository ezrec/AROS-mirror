Version 1.83pl13

	Changes by Aaron Digulla

    BF - (23.9.94) fixed bug in DELINE if there was a block below.
    BF - fixed bug in BMOVE when two windows were involved
    NF - the SMakefile now generates the date via `rx date`
    BF - bug fix in util/var/fd.c (does remove all leading spaces now).
    NF - (26.9.94) all commands are generated atomatically now

	Changes by B. Noll

    CM - (9.9.94) removed some dead assignments in menu/*, var/*, mod/*, key/*
    CM - (10.9.94) renamed jabba.c into _SPC_.c,
	 ** Please note that the commands  usekeytable, usemenustrip, rxresult,
	 ** chfilename and cd can _not_ be replaced by do_setspecialvar()
    NF - (11.9.94) special variable "itemcheck" represents the checkvalue of
	 the current active menuitem, if it is invoked by menuselection
	 (menucontrol, spc.pre)
    NF - (11.9.94) added an smaller icon for subs'makemygadget (subs.c)
    BF - (11.9.94) macros'add_record did not initialize correctly (macros.c)
    NF - (11.9.94) new commands request, reqstring, reqnumber, reqpalette,
	 reqfile new module Mod/request.c (request.c (new), spc.pre, command.c)
	 ok, that module can be eliminated if everybody used some ARexx libs,
	 but so these commands need only 1.5K (perhaps a non-ReqTools version?)
    ?? - (12.9.94) Made a nearly AUISG conform menu (german) also usable for
	 novice users; any place to put it? (Docs/sample.edrc)
    NF - (13.9.94) simple Commandshell added; command "opencmdshell" opens it;
	 variables cmdshellname, cmdshellprompt, cmdshell (Mod/CMDSH.c (new),
	 main.c, command.c, SPC.pre)
	 ok, the synchroneous method via "source CON:..." worked too, but
	 that asynchroneous one might be better to use.
    ?? - (14.9.94) translated the auisg menu to english
    NF - (14.9.94) Command documentation for Request.c, CmdSh.c
    CM - (16.9.94) added the File StdCommands.c and the generated File _COM_.c
	 the first keeps trace of all commands, which are not defined inside
	 of their modules, the other is a sorted list of all occurencies of
	 "ENODE"; hat way it is much easier to include/exclude a special
	 command module into/from the distribution, since we can keep command
	 definition and implementation together. (better filenames!?)
	 This is IMHO the more convenient method - just move a file out of the
	 SourceTree do disable all of its commands (and kill it in the
	 Makefile) inorder to remove its commands from XDMe
    NF - (16.9.94) added the commands "dropvar" & "printf"; in fact they
	 had been present for a while, but I just had forgotten to put them
	 into command.c (now that job is performed automatically, see
	 previous CodeModification)
    CM - (19.9.94) renamed the keyword for COMMAND-nodes from ENODE to COMMAND
	 since this seems to me a better name.
    CM - (19.9.94) Macros'saverecord writes "simptr" statements only if the
	 following record entry is not a single default keypress.
    BF - (22.9.94) "space" requested an argument it did not use (edit.c)
    CM - (21.9.94) changed SET for some str-specials to "strrep" (SPC.pre,
	 spc.c)
    NF - (21.9.94) added AppIcon (mod/APIC.c (new) main.c SPC.pre) currently
	 controlable via variables only:
	    appicon(%|title|name|(drop|click)action)
    NF - (21.9.94) added some specialflags: norequest, showtitle, comlinemode,
	 followcursor, nicepaging, iconactive (spc.pre)
	 Why the hell are so many [string]variables declared "static"
    CM - (21.9.94) removed commata behind all COMMAND-lines to be able to put
	 them into code (several ...)
    NF - (21.9.94) "new" command "SPC spcvarname value" set a specialvar
	 (vars.c, spc.c) now the probs w/ keymap/SPC vs. var/SPC_* are gone...
    NF - (21.9.94) some more support for "shortlines"
    BF - (20.9.94) "closecmdshell" now works! (thanx Aaron - I'll have to buy
	 the AGB, too!)
    NF - the SMakefile now generates the date via `rx date`

	Changes by Todd M. Lewis

Version 1.83pl12

	Changes by Aaron Digulla

    NF - (14.9.94) added code by Todd M. Lewis which simplyfies the handling
	 of blocks. Added his name to the about-window.
    CF - moved the version string into about.c so only this file needs to
	 be compiled every time.
    CF - (15.9.94) changed the code to scroll XDMEs window slightly. Now
	 XDME scrolls only the absolute neccessary bitplanes. If you choose
	 a foreground-pen 1,2,4,8,etc, XDME will scroll only one bitplane.
	 It's FAST now :)
    NF - (21.9.94) Changed format of XDME-prefs file again. But this time
	 it's not neccessary to use CnvConfig to adjust. The change was due
	 to an idea of Mr. Lewis who said "Just add some empty fields so
	 you can add new stuff at any time without having to run CnvConfig
	 every time". This should be the last change of Config for quite
	 some time. If you want to be save, start XDME and save the config
	 via Menu or SAVECONFIG.
    BF - IF uses now is_gflagset() instead of do_toggle(). Removed do_toggle.
    NF - All flags (in Ep, Ep->config and globalflags) are now accessed by
	 macros GETF_xxx(ed) and SETF_xxx(ed) where xxx is the name of the
	 flag in uppercase and ed is the editor the flag is requested for
	 (ignored for global flags). To make sure that everyone accesses
	 the flags via these macros, the names of all flags have been
	 changed.
    NF - instead of Prototype() the macro DEFCMD() can be used like this:

	    DEFCMD(void,foo,(int))
	    {
		...
	    } /* foo */

	 which is short for

	    Prototype void foo (int);

	    void foo (int)
	    {
		...
	    } /* foo */

	 The definition is #define DEFCMD(returntype,name,params). Don't
	 forget the commas and the parentheses around the parameters.

	Changes by Todd M. Lewis

    NF - With the flag BLOCKENDSFLOAT, you can specify if XDME should always
	 take the upper end of the block as the start even if the lower end
	 was set with BSTART (on). The default behaviour is to preserve the
	 order (ie. if BSTART is below BEND, the next BSTART will change the
	 lower end and not the upper). Note that you cannot mark blocks
	 with the mouse anymore if you switch this on if you drag it left/up.
	 Down/right is not affected.

Version 1.83pl11

	Changes Aaron Digulla

    BF - (13.9.94) fixed bug in ABOUT (comma at wrong position resulting in
	 a "weird" about-window)
    BF - XDME did not show the InsertMode in the title anymore. The new
	 field of the pattern is "%i" which is empty if insertmode is on
	 and "Ovr" is insertmode is off.
    BF - some sources were missing in the distribution

Version 1.83pl10

	Changes Aaron Digulla

    NF - (7.9.94) part of the docs and the list of commands are generated
	 from the sources now.
    BF - added some missing commands to the docs
    CF - cleaned the code in Src/prefs.c a bit. Added tas_arg (test and set,
	 like test_arg(), but also displays the result in the title bar),
	 SetXDMEPen() to change a pen and check all errors and CheckExt()
	 to allow "setpen topaz 10" as well as "setpen topaz.font 10"
    CF - The version is now 1.83plXX instead of 1.83.XX since VERSION
	 has its problems with the other format.
    NF - Added command ABOUT which shows version and date of comilation.
    BF - Join will now ignore all spaces at the end of the current and
	 at the beginning of the next line in all cases.
    BF - DELINE would generate an illegal block if the last line of a block
	 was deleted.
    NF - added command SETDEFTITLE to set a pattern for the title of XDME.
	 for the iconified window, the command is SETDEFICONTITLE.
    NF - the old DME way to scroll (without jumping to the window border
	 beforehand) can now be activated with the NICEPAGING command.
    NF - if you want the iconified window be active after ICONIFY, you
	 set this with ICONACTIVE
    BF - POP BLOCK will now make sure the display will look correct.
    BF - POP ED did not activate the current window.

	Changes Bernd Noll

    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface "intuitiontitles" to switch on
	 SetWindowTitles instead of the old method (smallspc.c)
    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface to "dobak" (no effect yet) (s.a.)
    NF - (4.9.94) variable interface to "tfpen" title foreground pen
	 (s.a.)
    CF - (4.9.94) renamed variable interface "tpen" for title background pen
	 to "tbpen", since there is also "tfpen" (s.a.)
    CM - (4.9.94) eliminated some "dead assignments" in Mod/*
    BF - (4.9.94) reported & corrected a newly introduced bug in "showlog"
    BF - (4.9.94) re-incorporated bugfixes of 1.9.94 (menu*.c)
    BF - (4.9.94) corrected a +/- sign in AVL.c (why did nobody report that!?)
    NF - (6.9.94) replaced SmallSPC.c by a new partly automatically generated
	 module; added some new Specialvars, and put Special-Vars, -Flags +
	 -Ints together. (SmallSPC.c (killed) vars.c spc.c (new) spc.pre (new))
	 Variable Search is speed up about 5% only (had wished a better value)
	 (the functionality of PUSH, POP, PEEK can also be reached w/ PUSHVAR,
	 POPVAR, PICKVAR, DROPVAR now)
    CF/BF - keycodes now expect longnames like nk0, f10, ... to be lower case
	 there had been interferences between the "SPC_" prefix in PATCH_JUX
	 and the "spc" key... (KeyCodes.c)

Version 1.83.09

	Changes Aaron Digulla

    BF - XDME did not check for a window-resize when refreshing was neccessary
	(ie. when the XDME window becomes exposed).
    BF - Bug in TOMOUSE. XDME compared the X-position with the number of
	Lines and the Y-pos with the number of columns. Should be the other
	way round.
    NF - added left, right and center to JUSTIFY.
    BF - Fixed some bugs in search. XDME should find all occurences in
	both directions, now.
    BF - another bug fix in window-refresh. Window refresh works now, when
	a block is visible.
    BF - XDME uses only those planes for scrolling it needs, again. This
	results in a much faster scrolling since XDME needs only 2 planes
	in most cases.
    BF - The ICONIFY gadget was one pixel too far to the left

	Changes Bernd Noll

    CM - (12.8.94) Made the Files Src/Var/* Src/Mod/* Src/Key/* gcc-compilable
    BF - (12.8.94) wbstarted XDME refused to save a file, that had a Def.icon
    NF - (12.8.94) Special Flag "saveicons" also for cli-started processes
	 (replacement of "Wdisabled", which had the opposite effect)
    BF - (12.8.94) "showlog" had obviously never worked
    CM - (15.8.94) moved Src/Var/VarStack.c into Src/Mod since this is only a
	 support module (preparing replacement of Src/Var/* by a more flexible
	 concept with a little bit more structure)
    CM - (15.8.94) we are using "IDCMP_INACTIVE" to make sure the title looks ok
    NF - (15.8.94) the variable "iconname" (NO Special Variable) is controlling
	 the used icon image; if there is no such variable set or the according
	 ".info" file is not found, we use the internal image.
	 (that variable should per default point to "ENV:Sys/def_Text.info")
    BF - (15.8.94) Removed a bug in "saveicons" (did not use the full appname)
    BF - (15.8.94) Removed a bug in "showlog" (there is still one left: we do
	 not check, if there is already a log window open)
    NF - (15.8.94) added command "readtemplate" to insert a file and replace some
	 variable-references by their values; added file "Src/Mod/tplter.c"
    BF - (15.8.94) Shell-vars were not recognized like ENV vars; replaced some
	 FileAccess ("ENV:") by calls to DosLib (Get/Set-Var) (I had forgotten to
	 replace vars.c by my own module ...)
    NF - Flag to control, if the title is using TPEN or the Intuition color
	 (not accessible yet)
    CF - (18.8.94) SIMPTR now uses pixel values ... (macros.c)
    BF - (21.8.94) "if/ifelse/while cb ..." would not work if Cursor at
	 blockborder (e.g. block.topline) (cmd.c)
    BF - (21.8.94) Fixed Bug from 13.8.: DefIcons would not be accepted
	 via WB-start; (main.c)
    CM - (22.8.94) made some files gcc-compatible (amiga.c, block.c/defs.h,
	 win.c) now almost all files compile w/ no gcc-warnings (I had to
	 modify the c=bm includes/clib/(exec|dos)_protos.h, though)

Version 1.83.08

	Changes Aaron Digulla

    BF - if a window concealed part of the XDME window, the scroller would
	not follow the mouse
    BF - if XDME misses the mousebutton-up-message, it looks into the
	qualifiers. If there is no mousebutton, XDME stops listening
	to MOUSEMOVE and INTUITICKS.
    CF - XDME will not allow to resize the window when it refreshes its
	window.
    BF - many dead assignments removed
    NF - XDME is now compiled using all available optimizations
    NF - new format of History-File
    NF - A (incomplete) list of all people that reported bugs
    NF - made refs.c recognise the output of etags
    MBF - XDME comes now with an AmigaGuide-File with all commands ! YEAH :-)

	Changes Bernd Noll

    NF - the source of XDME is now spread over many different subdirs
    NF - XDME uses RCS now
    BF - Added some patches to refs.c
    BF - much work in src/key/, src/var and src/mod.
