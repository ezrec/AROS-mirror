Now look what you've done.  I've actually started writing code to
implement block operations on the other types of blocks.  Like
I don't have anything better to do than that.  :-)

Ok, about vertical blocks:  How do you want the inserts to work?
To use the images from before for example, if we copy the block of
'b's to where the '+'s are what do we get?

    old:
      Useful informative text before the table
       ------- ------- ------  -- bbbbbbb
       ------- +++++++ ------- -- bbbbbbb
       ------- wwwwwww ------- ----------
       ------- xxxxxxx ------- ------- --
       -------  2345   ------- ------- --
       ------- zzzzzzz ------- ------- --
      More useful informative text after the
      table which we really don't want to
      screw up with block operations above.

What will we end up with in this case?

By the way, at this point I have all the hooks in to support
horizontal blocks--that is to say horizontal blocks are now
supported to the same extent that vertical blocks were
supported in 1.83.08.

One more question: How does that numbering scheme work?
I mean why 1.83.08?  Why not 94.8.30 or something else?
Just curious?

One more one more question: Suppose I get this block
stuff working nicely?  How would you like to get the 

changes?  I could bundle just the files I've changed
and include a 'diff' listing if that would help.
I don't know what my time table is on this stuff, but
it shouldn't take a lot of coding time.  It may take
a while to _get_ the coding time it will take though.
I hope to have something to show you in a week or two.

Later,

Hello Aaron,
 
I regrettably send you the wrong message. I hope you will not be too
upset about that. This is the text you should have received:
 
 
Hello Aaron,
 
I like the program XDME a lot. I am sure I will make it my favourite
text writer. I now have Version 1.54. The nice thing about this editor
is that it is fully and indeed fully programmable.
 
But alas there is always more to hope for. One thing that bothers me
is that I have to start from a deep-down directory and read the
project_file from that directory only. I wanted to make a click-and-run
environment for my Aztec compiler. But now I have to wade through a lot
of sub-directories to start XDME. Is it possible to save a project at a
fixed place and on later startup read it from there? From within XDME
I do not see a way to solve the problem and Arexx and 'select ...' don't
seem to work together.
 
I hope you will send me your latest update, if you changed the rules
please let me know.
 
You can send E-Mail to me at sarel@xs4all.hacktic.nl
 
Freindly greetings,
 
Frank.
file from that directory and not from one central place. I wanted 
to make a TurboPascal like environment for my AzteC compiler. To start 
building my projects with just a click from Workbench. From within XDME
I see no solution and Arexx end the select command don't work. My
suggestion


:

make a command like projectload file-name.

I hope you will send me the latest update of your program.

You can send it to 'sarel@xs4all.hacktic.nl'.

Thank you,

Frank.

After reviewing which files include which other files, I have
determined that the proper place for the #defines are as follows: 


include/defs.h
   #ifndef BLOCK_C
   #   define NOT_BLOCK_C_CONST const
   #else
   #   define NOT_BLOCK_C_CONST
   #endif

src/block.c
   ...
   #define BLOCK_C 1
   ...
   #include "whatever (didn't write that part down).h"
   ...
   Prototype NOT_BLOCK_C_CONST Block ActualBlock;
   Block ActualBlock = { NULL, BT_NONE, ...whatever

I tried this last night and it works well.  The compiler behaves as it
should and refuses to compile modules other than block.c which try to
change fields in ActualBlock.  All the functions I had been using to
read fields in ActualBlock have been changed back to references, and
the code is beautiful and clean again. 


I highly recommend this technique for other modules with global
visible data with semantics which need to be controlled.

A couple of other functions that have proven quite handy:
  Column block_leftcolumn( Line line) and
  Column block_rightcolumn(Line line)
They return the left- or right-most column the block covers
on the given line, or -1 if the block does not extend to that line.

By the way, I hadn't mentioned this before--being stuck in the
U.S. where one has to go out of his way to notice there are languages
besides English--but I really do appreciate your using english for
documentation and comments (and e-mail).  Your command of the
language (at least written) is good to the extent that I wouldn't be
surprised if it were your native language.  After looking over
src/hrexx.c I'm convinced that I couldn't begin to collaborate with
you on XDME without your skill in my language.  Thanks.

Where exactly is "fh-konstanz.de" anyway?  I mean, what city?
Just curious really--I was trying to find you on a map...
=============

On a lighter note: I'm thinking of translating XDME to the language
called C+-.  Here's a brief description of C+- passed on to me from
a friend.  Enjoy...


C+-
(pronounced "C more or less")

Unlike C++, C+- is a subject oriented language.  Each C+- class
instance known as a subject, holds hidden members, known as
prejudices or undeclared preferences, which are impervious to
outside messages, as well as public members known as boasts or
claims.  The following C operators are overridden as shown: 


>       better than
<       worse than
>>      much better than
<<      forget it
!       not on your life
==      comparable, other things being equal.

C+- is a strongly typed language based on stereotyping and
self-righteous logic.  The Boolean variables TRUE and FALSE (known
as constants in less realistic languages) are supplemented with
CREDIBLE and DUBIOUS, which are fuzzier than Zadeh's traditional
fuzzy categories.  All Booleans can be declared with the modifiers
strong and weak.  Weak implication is said to "preserve deniability"
and was added at the request of the D.O.D. to ensure compatability
with future versions of Ada. Well-formed falsehoods (WFFs) are
assignment-compatible with all Booleans. What-if and why-not
interactions are aided by the special conditional evenifnot X then Y.  


C+- supports information hiding and, among friend classes only,
rumor sharing.  Borrowing from the Eiffel lexicon, non-friend
classes can be killed by arranging contracts.  Note that friendships
are intransitive, volatile, and non-Abelian. 


Single and multiple inheritance mechanisms are implemented with
random mutations.  Disinheritance rules are covered by a complex
probate protocol. In addition to base, derrived, virtual, and
abstract classes, C+- supports gut classes.  In certian locales,
polygamous derivations and bastard classes are permitted.
Elsewhere, loose coupling between classes is illegal, so the
marriage and divorce operators may be needed: 


marriage (MParent1, FParent1);
// child classes can now be derrived
sclass MySclass: public MParent1, FParent1
{       //  define MySclass

sclass YourSclass: public MParent1, FParent2
// illegitimate

divorce (MParent1, FParent1);

marriage (MParent1, FParent2);
sclass YourSclass: public MParent1, FParent2
{  //  OK now

Operator precedence rules can be suspended with the directive
#pragma  dwim, known as the "Do what I mean" pragma.  ANSIfication will
be firmly resisted. C+-'s slogan is "Be Your Own Standard."

Subject: XDMD v1.00
Status: RO

	I have just uploaded version 1.00 of XDMD to the aminet.  It
should appear as util/rexx/xdmd1.lha.  XDMD stands for "XDME Macros by
Duniho."  It is the successor to DMD, which I last released a couple
years ago.  XDMD does for XDME what DMD did for DME, and it does a lot
more.  XDMD is an integrated system of macros, menus, keymappings,
ARexx scripts, and programs that together make XDME much more powerful
that it is by itself.  Its features include spell checking, outlining,
localized major modes, automatic mode selection upon loading, various
Emacs-like keymappings, region and rectangle editing a la Emacs, xpk
support, diary maintenance, pagination, many requesters, a "Windows"
menu that keeps track of each open file, and many other features.  I
hope that XDMD will give the authors of XDME a better feel for its
capabilities and limitations.  And I hope it will inspire further
development of XDME.

	Well, the archive contains a humongous dictionary that makes
it fairly large.  But if you remove the dictionary, the rest isn't
very large at all.  So I would recommend including it without the
dictionary. 

AD> If you need any enhancements to make XDME suit your needs better,

	I do have some suggestions.  Here they are off the top of my
head.  Some of these may be different ways around the same problems.  

* A flag for "if" and "while" which indicates whether there is a block
* at all.

* Make "goto block," "goto start," and "goto end" go nowhere when
* there is no block.

* Make "bmove," "bcopy," and "bdelete" work with all blocks.

* Make "bsave," "barpsave," and "bappendsave" work properly with
* character blocks and vertical blocks, i.e. make them save only the
* text that is actually blocked.

* Make blocktype local.

* A couple flags for "if" that indicate whether the blocktype is line
* and whether it is character.  These could be used like I currently
* use toggles 5 and 6 with my "block-type?" macro.

* A flag for "if" and "while" that indicates whether the cursor is at
* the first non-blank in a line.

* Commands that do what my "spaces" and "string" macros do, since they
* are a bit slow.  

* Expand scanf, such that if you put a "-" before an argument, you
* will get everything to the left.  For example, "-w" would give you
* what "+w" gives you minus what "w" gives you.

* Give the option of regularly refreshing the screen, like XDME used
* to do.  This is for the sake of using requesters, such as a spell
* checking requester, that stay up for a while.  The way it currently
* works, there is a blank area left behind when I move a requester.

* Make wordwrap and "reformat" use a fill-prefix like the filling
* commands in Emacs do.

* Add array capability.

* Make "select window=" work with complete file names, or let it work
* with aliases for window names.  Currently, my "Windows" menu doesn't
* work well with two files from different directories that have the
* same name.

	That's it for now.  Maybe I'll think of other things another
time.  I hope you appreciate these suggestions and aren't sorry you
asked.  :)

	I was about to say that's as good as anything, but then I
recalled that "bl" is more appropriate for another flag I suggested
later on.  I was thinking of "bl" and "bc" for the flags that indicate
whether the blocktype is line and whether it is character.  Perhaps a
"bv" as well, just to round things out.  Perhaps "bm" for "Block
Marked" will do.

AD> > * Add array capability.
AD> 
AD> Be a bit more specific here, please.

	OK.  I am thinking of variables that could be accessed by a
numeric index.  They might look like this: var[1], v[6], etc.  Here is
a sample line of code that shows how they might work:

(set a 3 set v[3] (DOS ist goot) insert v[\$a])

	This line of code would insert into the text the string "DOS
ist goot".  What would also be helpful with arrays is a command,
perhaps called arrayload, which loads a file into an array instead of
into a window.  It would take an arrayname as an argument, and it
would load the first line into the first member of the array, the
second into the second, etc.  It would also return the size, perhaps
in the zeroeth member of the array.

	This sort of capability would be useful with AlphaSpell, which
generates a list of misspelled words.  I may experiment with lists and
stacks to see if I can get a similar effect.  I want to be able to
store all the misspelled words and retrieve them one-by-one without
keeping an ARexx script running.  Lists might not work, because as I
implemented them, they are long strings, and there is a limit to the
string size.  But a couple variable stacks might do the job.  Arrays
might not be so necessary after all.  I think I now know how to (sort
of) simulate an array with a couple variable stacks.  So you can make
this low priority if it isn't a simple thing to implement.

Hi!

Wie weit bist Du mit der Dipl.Arbeit? Schon abgegeben?

Wenn nicht, weiterhin viel Erfolg ;-)

Wenn ja...

* hast Du schon ueberlegt wann wir/Du mit der Umsetzung
  des XDME beginnen/-st?
  Wenn es noch eine laengere Zeit dauert, werde
  ich naemlich damit beginnen an den Zentralen Funktionen des
  XDME noch ein wenig rumzupfuschen (main, do_command, error,
  text[un]init) und dort die bisherige Loesung (Spaghetti) durch
  eine automatisierte Loesung (machine generated Spaghetti) wie
  bei gen_spc zu ersetzen und so ein wenig mehr Modularisierung
  zu erreichen ...
  (wir haben z.Zt 5 Kommando Trees: command, makro, key,
  menu, arexx, 5 SigHandler: ctl-c, Arexx, AppIcon, CmdSh und
  Intuition, 3 Ausgaebemedien: CmdSh, Requestor, Log und bei
  dem Oeffnen/Loeschen von Projekten muessen auch schon mehrere
  Module benachrichtigt werden (z.B. Vars fuer TextVars, Cmd fuer
  Stack, demnaechst von VarStack ...)

* Wollte Bescheid gesagt haben, dass ich von den YADME Sources
  das REQREPLACE Kommando adaptiert und fuer einige andere
  Kommandos (sofern moeglich) Simulationsmakros gebastelt habe.
  (Word-blocks latuernich genausowenig wie Processwnd)

* Hatte hier einen Bugreport mit Keymappings ...
  Das Problem liess sich auf keinen Fehler im Pgm
  zurueckfuehren, sondern:

    in 'XDME/s/.edrc' verwendest Du Menushortcuts case sensitiv;
    das geht in die Hose, da die Menu-shortcuts nicht von uns,
    sondern von Intuition ausgewertet werden, und Intuition sie
    case _IN_sensitiv interpretiert ...
    Da dieses .edrc File den Leuten auch als Example dient, sollten
    wir das besser beseitigen ...

* Koennen wir dem REQFONT Kommando noch ein paar Parameter geben?
  (wir verfuegen neuerdings ueber mindestens 2 Fonts:
   MENUFONT und TEXTFONT; und ich halte es daher fuer sinnvoll,
   einen variablen FontRequester zur Verfuegung zu stellen ...

* Nein ich habe an den Oberontexten nix weiter gemacht ausser einer
  rudimentaeren Speicherverwaltung mit Read & Write in C und einem
  rudimentaeren Insert/Delete ... (wieso heisst das Archiv eingentlich
  xdme_3_ ?????), dafuer ein paar ungeloeste konzeptionelle Fragen:

  - Wenn ein neues Segment eingebaut wird, um Attribute zu aendern,
    anzupassen, so bekommen wir bei der Filerepraesentation Inkonsistenzen
    zwischen der Dateilaenge im RAM und der Dateilaenge auf Disk ...
    da Du alle Zugriffe aber ueber Offset realisiert hast, kann das zu
    echten Verwirrungen fuehren ...
    wir muessten in diesem Augenblick dem Segment n PseudoChars mehr
    zuordnen, die nicht im Text ersheinen, sondern nur die Umschaltsymbole
    repraesentieren - ehrlich gesagt klingt das nicht gut...
    Analog koennte man den Gedaken weitersinnen bei eingebundenen Bldern ...
    der Cursor sitzt direkt vor einem Icon, der Benutzer drueckt DELETE -
    nun muesste eigentlich das Bild geloescht werden, aber dann muss
    das Icon-Segment ebenfalls eine Pseudogroesse von einem Character haben ...

  - Waere es nicht etwas sinnvoller anstatt reinen Offset Cursorn
    ebenfalls Zeile/Spalte mitzuziehen? das sind Angaben, die imho
    staendig verfuegbar sein sollten; und es ist m.E. nicht so gut,
    wenn wir diese Werte nach jeder Aktion neu berechnen lassen,
    wenn wir sie auch waehrend der Textaenderungen updaten koennten ...

  - Soll im Zuge der Umstellung nach Oberontexten eigentlich die
    Moeglichkeit bestehen bleiben, dass der Cursor _hinter_ das
    Zeilenende bewegt wird?
    (dann stellt sich die Frage, ob das von der Applikation oder
    der Textverwaltung gemacht wird - ich bin der Meinung, dass es
    in die Text/Cursorverwaltung hineingehoert ...(aber da koennten
    unsere Meinungen ebenso divergieren wie bei Wortbloecken))

* Menues koennten nun auch mit einem anderen Font gerendert werden
  (es fehlt aber noch die Moeglichkeit, ihn zu setzen ...)

* In VarStack habe ich nun eine Cleanuproutine, die bei text_uninit()
  angesprungen werden kann, sie ist aber noch nicht enabled ...

Subject: Some more suggestions for improving XDME
Status: RO

	Hi Aaron,

	Here are some more suggestions for improving XDME:

* A whole word search mode.  This would be useful for spell-checking,
* for searching for short words, and for special macros that need to
* find a particular word for some reason.  

* A special flag that indicates whether the last command failed.  This
* could be set by the force command, since "force f" is required for a
* macro to continue after a command fails.  This flag would be useful
* for taking different action in case of a failure.

* An ANSI display mode, since no ANSI editor comes close to having the
* power of XDME.  Ideally, reformat and wordwrap would ignore ANSI
* codes in this mode, so that lines with ANSI codes wouldn't be
* prematurely cut off.

	I didn't think of that.  That's a nice, intuitive way of doing
it.  Do C and N mean the same thing?  I've noticed that the titlebar
has an N in it when I select the character blocktype.  What does "N"
stand for?

	I haven't tried that, but I'm not so sure that it would work.
There are some limitations to what you can do with inline ARexx
scripts, i.e. one-line scripts that get put in .edrc.  For example, I
tried to write one that would indicate whether an array member
existed, by returning the value of $(?arrayn), but it wouldn't work.

AD> Or have you ever tried "source con:" ?

	I did after you mentioned it here.  It's impressive, but
opencmdshell sort of undercuts how impressive it is.

Subject: Another idea for XDME
Status: RO

	Hi Aaron,

	Here are a few more ideas for XDME.  I thought of the second
two while writing the first one.

* A command that executes a CLI command with the contents of the
* current window as standard input?  It would be some sort of
* combination of execute and saveold.

* A command that executes a CLI command and loads the standard output
* from the program into a window, replacing what is already there.

* A command which does both.  It sends the window's current contents
* to standard input and replaces it with the output from the program.

	Here's another I just thought of:

* A command like the second one, which just inserts the output from
* the CLI program.

	And another I just thought of while writing the preceding:

* One like the first one, which works on blocks.  And one like the
* third one, which works on blocks.

	Perhaps some of these ideas could be combined into the same
command.  Their main purpose would be to eliminate the need to write
temporary files.  Uses would include sending a file to a
spell-checker, automatic packing and unpacking of files during saving
and loading, transforming a file or block in some way, etc.
Basically, these are things that I already have XDME doing, but
commands such as these would reduce the constraints caused by limited
memory.  I wonder if anything could be done for programs that do not
use standard input or output.

Mit diesem "bekannten Fehler" könnte ich ohne Probleme Leben, dann wird der

Hi!

XDME/

    - mktags
	kann raus - ist m.W. auch im SMakefile enthalten

    - test
	kann raus - oder ?


XDME/Docs/

    - 'History'
	in xdme..._beta.lha war eine Datei 'XDME/Docs/History.0'
	die ich verwendete, nachdem ich 'History' abgeschossen hatte
	Es waere evtl. geschickt, die vor 'History' zu pasten.

    - 'XDME.doc' 'README'
	sollten in den Trashcan wandern - ich glaube nicht, dass die jemals
	wieder aufgearbeitet werden.

    - 'Contents' 'INSTALL'
	sollten einmal ueberarbeitet werden
	(e.g. NULL: wird doch nicht mehr benoetigt - oder?)

    - 'HINTS'
	1. warum erwaehnst Du nicht einfach 'nicepaging'
	2. wie haben wir etwa _kein_ GLOBALSEARCH ?????

XDME/Src/

    - Kalle/* ist ja doch dringeblieben !?

Hallo Aaron,

vielen Dank fuer Deine Arbeit an dem wunderbaren XDME!!
Ich benutze diesen Editor jetzt schon bestimmt ueber ein Jahr und bin sehr
zufrieden, aber ein paar Vorschlaege haette ich trotzdem noch:

1. Das Blockmarkieren mit der Maus sollte ueberarbeitet werden. Zur Zeit
   benutze ich PowerSnap, falls ich einen Block kopieren will.
2. Die Blockarten (Wort, Zeile, vertikaler Block) sollte automatisch
   funktioneren. (Ist im CED sehr schoen geloest, ebenso wie das
   Markieren.)
3. Einige .edrc Files sollten beigelegt werden um den Usern so viele
   Beispiele wie moeglich zur Verfuegung zu stellen.
4. Vielleicht mach ich da nur etwas falsch, aber wenn ich ein File lade,
   dann mit arpsave in einem anderen Pfad oder unter einem anderen Namen
   abspeichere, dann editiere und diesmal mit saveold abspeichere, so wird
   das Originalfile ueberschrieben.

Um Dir gleich beim dritten Punkt unter die Arme zu greifen poste ich mein
.edrc-File, es ist bestimmt nicht perfekt, entspricht aber einigermassen
meinen Anforderungen. Falls Du Dich wirklich entschliesst mein .edrc zu
Veroeffentlichen kann ich natuerlich entweder

a) das .edrc-File selber zeilenweise dokumentieren, oder
b) ein extra Dokumentent dazu schreiben.

Ausserdem wuerde ich das ganze File nochmal ueberarbeiten (wenn ich mir das
ganze so anschaue, siehr ja aus wie Kraut und Rueben ;).
