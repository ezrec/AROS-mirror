README for GNU `indent'

Read the file NEWS for more information, especially to see what's
different from the last version, and what future versions may do.  If
you are installing indent on VMS, see the file VMS-README.


SIMPLE INSTALLATION

  Once you have unpacked the tar file, simply type "make" in the source
  directory to produce an executable copy of `indent' in that directory.
  If you then type "make install", the program will be installed by
  default as /usr/local/bin/indent and the on-line help will be
  installed as /usr/local/info/indent.info (see DOCUMENTATION, below).

  It is possible to change these default installation paths.  To change
  the place where `indent' is installed, you may specify the prefix
  directory as an argument to make like so:

    make prefix=/usr/gnu

  This will install `indent' as /usr/gnu/bin/indent and the info node as
  /usr/gnu/info/indent.info.

  To specify separate executable and info directories, specify them
  like this:

    make prefix=/doc exec_prefix=/usr

  This will install `indent' as /usr/bin/indent and the info node as
  /doc/info/indent.info.


SEPARATE CONFIGURATION

  Like most GNU software, `indent' uses the program `configure' to
  determine certain system-dependent parameters and construct the
  makefile.  In the example above, the master makefile passes its
  arguments (if any) to the configure program, and then calls `make'
  recursively to build `indent'.  Thus the last example is equivalent
  to:

    configure --prefix=/doc --exec-prefix=/usr
    make

  With `configure', it is also possible to build the program in a
  separate directory from the source by running `configure' in that
  separate directory with the source directory as the "--srcdir"
  argument to `configure'.
  
  For example, if the `indent' source is located in the directory
  /SYSTEM_A/src/indent and you want to build a copy in /SYSTEM_B/test/,
  you can do the following:
    
    cd /SYSTEM_B/test
    /SYSTEM_A/src/indent/configure --srcdir=/SYSTEM_A/src/indent
    make

  which will produce the the executable file /SYSTEM_B/test/indent.  For
  more information on `configure', see the included file CONF-README.


DOCUMENTATION

  GNU uses a language called "texinfo" for its documentation which
  produces both an on-line, interactive version and a hardcopy version
  for printing.  The on-line version, `indent.info', is installed along
  with the executable by typing "make install".  Refer to the Texinfo
  manual for more information on this system.

  The hardcopy version is produced from the source file `indent.texinfo'
  in as either a DVI or Postscript format file.  To produce the DVI
  version, type:

    make indent.dvi

  To produce the Postscript version, type:

    make indent.ps

  Note that you must have the TeX typographical system installed for
  this to work.

  While a Unix-style "man" page is also provided in the file
  `indent.1', it was provided by a user and is unsupported.  It
  is likely to be several versions behind the program, and thus there
  is no provision for its installation.


INDENT BUGS

  The "-troff" option is not supported and is strongly deprecated.  A
  good thing for someone to do is to rewrite `indent' to generate TeX
  source as a hardcopy output option, amoung other things.  See the
  `Projects' file for more things to do.


BUG REPORTS

  Please address bug-reports and suggestions or comments to:

    bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu

  Please include in your subject line the string: "GNU indent";  my
  mail reader looks for this string, so if it doesn't appear, your
  report may be ignored.

  How to report bugs:

  Please begin your bug report with a concise and factual description
  of the behaviour you consider to be abberant.  If you have narrowed
  the problem down to the use of a particular option, please mention
  that.  In general, also be sure to mention the command line options
  used to invoke indent, as well as the contents of your .indent.pro
  if you are using one.

  Then include the *smallest possible* piece of code which generates
  the described symptom.  It is very helpful if you can manage to
  reduce the size of the sample code.

  Finally, if you have investigated the problem further, include
  debugger stack traces, modifications, or speculation you have.

SENDING CODE

  If you send a patch as part of your bug fix, or send me code for new
  features, please send them as diffs.  In particular, send me the
  result of "diff -c <old_file> <new_file>".

FUTURE OF INDENT

  While there is a long list of features to be added to indent, and
  likely a longer list of undiscovered bugs, I maintain `indent' on a
  volunteer basis.  If you or your company find `indent' useful and
  are interested in supporting it through funding, please send me
  mail.

  My consulting practice supports development and maintenance of other
  GNU tools as well.  If you have need of GNU or Unix-based
  consulting, please let me know.
