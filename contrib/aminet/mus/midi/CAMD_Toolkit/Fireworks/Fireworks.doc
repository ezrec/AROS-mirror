                      Fireworks - see music explode!
                   ------------------------------------

This  is  a  colourful  and  thrilling  little  eyecandy.   It  will  do an
extraordinary  realtime display of MIDI notes that are received on any CAMD
cluster.   You  can  for  example  use  it together with "playmf" from this
package.  The program even has the ability to control PlayMF.

Every MIDI file looks different.  Some songs look like going to light speed
in  "Star Wars".  Others look like the sky over Bagdad during the gulf war.
Some look like a fantastic laser show.

NEW:   Three  differend  rendering  modes should make everyone happy.  I am
especially  proud  of  the  new Fountain Mode.  It simulates gravity and is
still not much slower than the original "Laser mode".

The  notes  will  be sent off into the sky in all directions.  The angle is
varying with the pitch of the notes.  Soft notes will climb up slowly while
loud  notes  will  be  shot  into the sky like flak bullets.  The different
colours  represent  the different MIDI channels.

Play  around  with  the window sizes.  Narrow windows (either vertically or
horizontally) have a nice effect.

With  my  Picasso  II+  running  Picasso  96  1.34a,  I get about 10-25 FPS
depending  on how many notes are currently visible.  I have no problem with
sizing  the window to about half the size of my workbench desktop.  See the
General Tips section if the program doesn't run as smoothly as you wish.

The  option  to  load images as a backdrop into the fireworks window proves
how  fast  Gfx  board  blitters  can  be.  This is really amazing.  Use any
picture you like (as long as your datatypes support it).  But better choose
dark images to have a good contrast to the fireworks.


Requirements
------------

* OS 3.0 or better.

* installed camd.library (available on Aminet)

* any MIDI software using CAMD (e.g. Deluxe Music II, playmf)
  or an external MIDI interface for feeding MIDI notes.

* some free pens on your Workbench screen.

* perferrably a graphics board using Picasso96 or Cybergraphics
  for fast window refresh.


Psychedelic Comsumation of this Program
---------------------------------------

This  section  is  only for "hardcore users" who like going to the extreme.

EPILEPSY  WARNING:  If you are a person who suffers from epilepsy or if you
are  known  to  have  a  high risk of getting an epileptic attack caused by
visual stimulation (flashing lights etc) - THEN DO NOT TRY THIS.

For  best  fireworks  experience, you need a fast processor (030/50 is just
enough) and a fast graphics board.  Ideally you have a 17'' or 21'' Monitor
or for the ultimate kick:  a video or data beamer!

You  own  a good General MIDI, Roland GS or Yamaha XG synthesizer.  Ideally
you  have  built  my  waveblaster  hack  or  "Project  XG" from the British
CU-Amiga magazine.  Without sound, this is only half the fun it should be.

Check  the  "Hide  Title  Bar"  and  "Hide Mouseptr" menu options.  Put the
program  in  Fullscreen  mode  and choose a low resolution (320x240 is just
fine).  People with plenty of computing power may use a higher resolution.

Remove  the backdrop image from Fireworks (it's too bright and disturbing).
Turn  on  the  "Sparks"  option in Rendering Modes.  This will give you the
kick.   Begin  with  "Pixel  Mode"  and "Double Strength".  Best choice for
sensitivity  is probably "Med", but depends on the MIDI files you are going
to listen to.

Turn  off  the  light.   If  it is daytime, close the windows and curtains.
Your room needs to be dark as hell.

Make  your  monitor  bright  and  give  it a lot of contrast (but the black
background must remain black - not grey!)

Write a small shell script that will play your favourite (most psychedelic,
most  thrilling  or  whatever)  MIDI  files in a sequence (using PlayMF for
example).  I prefer Classical music (symphonies, orchestral pieces) because
they vary in speed and intensity.

Optionally: Get stoned (warning: illegal)

Start the script (music).

Take a distance of 1-2m to the screen in a comfortable chair.

Now  un-focus your eyes so that you don't see the screen in full sharpness.
Alternative:  take off your eye-glasses (may have the same effect).

Relax and enjoy the experience. Get flashed.



General Program Usage
---------------------

The  command  can  be started from shell or Workbench.  After starting, you
will  get  an  Intuition  window showing a still image.  Now use PlayMF and
play a MIDI file.  Enjoy the show.

If  the  program  appears  too  slow  to  you, then read the "General Tips"
section.   Especially important is to set the DRAGGING=NO tool type in your
Cybergraphics V3 monitor driver.

The  background  image  may  be  replaced  against  any other image that is
supported by your datatypes and fits into your memory.  This can be done by
using  the  intuition menu or by dragging and dropping the icon of an image
file into the Fireworks window.

MIDI  files  may  be played by dragging their icons onto the PlayMF window.
The  PlayMF  program  will  then be launched automatically.  Make sure that
Fireworks  can  find  PlayMF in the search path or as "/PlayMF/PlayMF" (the
original location in this distribution archive).

Furthermore,  the menu options in the MIDI menu allow to load any MIDI file
using  a file requester (see Bugs section concerning problems with MuiASL).
The currently played MIDI file can easily be stopped.

The intuition menus are quite self explanatory.

Fullscreen is probably the best experience.  For optimum performance choose
a  screenmode  with  enough  colours  (16 colors for the fireworks plus the
number  of  colours  your  backdrop  requires).   Try  to  use  low  screen
resolutions.  This will speed up screen refresh.

Double  strength  will  draw  all  the  lines twice as thick.  So they look
brighter  and  give  a  better contrast to the backdrop image.  This option
will slow down rendering a bit, though.

Release  Notes will kill any "hanging notes" that may have occured during a
buffer  overrun.   Buffer overruns can happen if the program is not able to
handle  the  incoming  notes,  for  example when it is blocked by intuition
menus or requesters.

Any  errors will be reported either in intuition requesters or to the shell
window you started the program from.

You  can  easily  change the MIDI link.  By entering a non existing cluster
(link)  name, you can create a new one.  So it is possible to have multiple
Fireworks  tasks  show different MIDI files.  Or you can show the same MIDI
fireworks with multiple tasks in different windows with different backdrops
;-)


CLI Usage
---------

The template for the shell command line is as follows

L=LINK/K,M=MODE/K/N,WX=WINX/K/N,WY=WINY/K/N,WW=WINW/K/N,WH=WINH/K/N,
I=IMAGE/K,T=TILE/S,FS=FULLSCREEN/S,D=DOUBLE/S,SP=SPARKS/S,GM/S,GS/S,XG/S,MT32/S,
NH=NOHOOKS/S,NTS=NOTIMESTAMPING/S

Description

* L=LINK/K  (Keyword)

The MIDI cluster to hook into.  Default is "out.0".  This will show you the
notes  that  are  going  to any external MIDI hardware.  Ideal for use with
playmf.

"in.0"  would  show  you  all  notes  that are coming from an external MIDI
interface at your serial port.

* M=MODE/K/N   (Keyword, numeric argument)

The rendering mode to use.  Currently there are three modes, numbered 1-3.
- 1 is Laser Mode (straight lines, known from earlier Fireworks versions)
- 2 is Pixel Mode (parabolic flight paths, but only pixels)
- 3 is Fountain Mode (parabolic flight paths and true rays)
Default is No. 3.

* S=SENSITIVITY/K/N   (Keyword, numeric argument)

The  sensitivity  setting  of  the  fireworks.  There are three modes which
correspond  to  the  sensitivity  settings  in  the  Intuition  Menu.  High
sensitivity means that notes will emit faster from the center.
- 1 is Max Sensitivity
- 2 is Med Sensitivity
- 3 is Min Sensitivity
Default is No. 1.

* WX=WINX/K/N, WY=WINY/K/N   (Keywords, numeric arguments)

The initial window position.

* WW=WINW/K/N, WH=WINH/K/N   (Keywords, numeric arguments)

The  initial  window  size.   The  width  and  height  refers  to the inner
dimensions and may vary between 64x64 and 1024x1024.

* I=IMAGE/K

Filename  of  any  image format that datatypes is able to load.  It will be
put as a backdrop image into the fireworks window.  Astronomy images or the
city  skylines  in moonshine make a good view.  The pictures will be scaled
to fit the window.

* T=TILE/S

Tile  the  backdrop  image  instead  of scaling it.  This is what Workbench
usually does with its backdrops.

* GS=FULLSCREEN/S

Open  the fireworks on a separate screen as a backdrop window.  This option
will bring up an ASL screenmode requester.

* D=DOUBLE/S

Draw all lines in double strength.

* SP=SPARKS/S

Adds glittering sparks to the fireworks.

* GM/S, GS/S, XG/S, MT32/S   (switches)

these  correspond  to  the  same  switches  of PlayMF.  Please refer to the
PlayMF documentation for more details.

* NH=NOHOOKS/S   (switch)

disables  the filetype recognition hooks in ASL filerequesters.  Will speed
things  up  and  fixes  compatibility  problems with some ASL replacements.
Make  sure to set this switch when using Mui-Asl (at least until the author
fixes the problem).

* NTS=NOTIMESTAMPING/S   (switch)

Disables  MIDI  timestamping.   Timestamping  makes Fireworks recognize the
exact  timing  of  all  MIDI  messages.  So the fireworks rendering becomes
exact,  even  if it runs on very low frame rates.  Even after fireworks has
been  suspended  for several seconds (e.g.  by other task or user activity)
the notes are still shown in their correct timing relations.

This  new  feature slows down fireworks very slightly.  So it has been made
optional an can be disabled with this switch.


General Tips
------------

This  program is optimized for use with Picasso96 and Cybergraphics V3.  It
will work on ECS/AGA systems as well, but maybe slower.

If  you  use Cybergraphics V3, set the DRAGGING=NO tooltype in your monitor
driver. Otherwise the program will be slow as hell.

The  program  uses "intelligent" timing routines that adapt to the speed of
your  screen  refresh.   The  program  runs  on a very low priority for not
disturbing your multitasking too much.

If  you have AGA only, try reducing the number of colours on your WB screen
for faster screen refresh.

The  fireworks  runs only smoothly if it can handle its graphics completely
with  the  onboard blitter of the graphics board.  If you use Cybergraphics
V3, please enable the option to keep BitMaps in the graphic card's RAM (set
DRAGGING=NO tooltype in the monitor driver).

Unload  any large workbench backdrops.  They are likely to eat a lot of the
graphic board's RAM.  Close other screens on your Gfx Board to increase the
amount  of  free graphics RAM.  This will allow the program to place larger
bitmaps  inside  your  graphics board.  Then you can make the window larger
without losing much refresh speed.

Better don't use 24 bit modes.  They use a lot of RAM and require more data
to be transferred over the bus and blitter.

Do  not  load  dithered  images  into Fireworks (turn off dithering in your
picture  or  JFIF  datatype when using CLUT modes).  Dithered pictures will
look awful when being scaled, especially when scaled to smaller sizes.


Bugs
----

well, seems to work fine, except...

*  major instability problem on some Cybergraphics system.  Especially when
resizing the window. Still looking for the problem.

*  The  ASL  filerequester  of  Fireworks  uses callback hooks for filetype
recognition.   The Mui-ASL replacement has not implemented this, so it will
show _NO_ files at all!  Ask the author to fix this (or at least show _all_
files).

* the program may be very slow on AGA machines.  If the CPU is used to copy
the  BitMaps  from  RAM to the graphics board, you have lost.  In this case
your  computer  will  become  slow  as hell.  However if you own one of the
latest  releases of Picasso96 or Cybergraphics, all the blitting is done in
the RAM of your graphics board using the onboard blitter.  -> Faaaast!


History
-------

Release 1-2: this program was not yet written.

Release 3: initial release of this program

Release 4: the program will stop its window refresh when no notes
           have to be displayed (idle mode).

           reduced the probability of "hanging" notes, especially
           after an MIDI buffer overflow occurs.

           coordinate calculation is a lot faster now. It uses
           integer maths and precalculated scale factors now.

           color palette is now a 360 degree rotation on the HSV
           color wheel (saturation 75%, brightness 100%).

           added WINW, WINH keywords

           added "intelligent" scheduler that will force a display
           refresh every 1/2 second if any other task runs at a
           higher priority. Make sure to set Fireworks to NOSCHEDULE
           ABOVE if you use Executive.

           improved performance on Cybergraphics systems (probably).
           forgot to use BMF_MINPLANES. Picasso96 tolerated this.

           added IMAGE keyword. Load datatype images as backdrops
           into the fireworks window! Also added menu options to
           remove and load images.

           active MIDI cluster is now shown in window title.

           Window title now tells you when Fireworks is in idle mode.

           added menu option to release notes (useful when notes are
           hanging after a buffer overrun or similar).

           when changing MIDI the link, all notes will be flushed.

           added menu option to enable double strength line rendering.

Release 5: major internal redesign

           added TILE switch and menu option

           added DOUBLE switch

           added FULLSCREEN switch and menu option and an ASL
           screenmode requester

           added drag and drop support for backdrop images.

           added drag and drop support for MIDI files.
           (requires PlayMF)

           added menu options to play and stop MIDI files.

           Fireworks became massively multithreaded. Most requesters
           are asynchronous. The main program continues to run if you
           are selecting a file/screenmode or viewing a message.

Release 6: improved screen palette (black blackground)

           added modular (multi-mode) design to support multiple modes.
           Added two new modes (Pixel and Fountain mode). This stuff
           is true high tech. So it may (or may not) contain bugs.

Release 7: added sensitivity switch and menu options.

           fixed some minor display bugs of the fireworks

           optimized and improved the fireworks code

           added glittering sparks to the fireworks

           modularized the source code a bit

           added MIDI initialisation switches and menu options

           added "psychedelic" section to this documentation. hehe.

           added menu option and switch to disable ASL hooks.

           fixed potential crash problem in Drag&Drop support

           implemented MIDI timestamping. This makes the recognition
           of note timing and length quite exact, even at low frame
           rates.

           implemented saving of preferences

           added menu options to hide title bar and mouse pointer


Future
------

* support MIDI volumes

* tool type support.

* palette preferences

* allow setting the center point and angle view.
