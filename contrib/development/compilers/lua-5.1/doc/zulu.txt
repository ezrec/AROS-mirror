Zulu - A MUI(Zune)-Lua binding
==============================

Introduction
------------

Zulu allows you to create MUI applications from Lua scripts. This is an alpha release without
support for callback hook functions.

If MUI is new to you, it is highly recommended that you download mui38dev.lha from
Aminet and study the documentation.

If you have already written MUI applications in C you will find many similarities. The biggest
difference is that Zulu uses real functions instead of preprocessor macros, so don't get
confused with the commas.


Installation
------------

Zulu is available in current AROS releases. In Extras/Development/Lua you can find
a binary 'AmiLua'. It is compiled with the linker lib luamui.a and the older luasiamiga.a.
You need an assign "lua" to the path "sys:extras/development/lua".


Hint
-----

An important thing before we go into details:
There is a difference between C and Lua which can make big trouble if you don't care about it:
When you write in C someting like 'x=function("aaa")' then the string is stored in a static
area. This means the string exists as long your program is in RAM.
But when you do the same in Lua then the string is created dynamically. Because the string has
no binding after the function call it will be deleted by the garbage collector.
So whenever the MUI documentation says that something must exist as long the object exists
you have to define it as global variable at the beginning of your program (e.g. str="aaa") 
and you aren't allowed to change or delete this variable.


Linker lib luamui.a
-------------------
The linker lib luamui.a defines two function tables: mui and strarray.


Functions in the mui table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

object = mui.new(class, tag1, value1, tag2, value2 , ...)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a wrapper for the muimaster function 'MUI_NewObject'. It creates new MUI objects.
The first argument is a string which defines a class (e.g. "String.mui"). This class strings
are defined as variables in muidefs.lua (e.g. MUIC_String). The following parameters are pairs
of tags and values. The final 'TAG_DONE' is added by the function.

Example:

text = mui.new(mui.MUIC_Text(mui.MUIA_Text_Contents, "Hello world!"))

object = mui.make(class, param1, param2 , ... )
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a wrapper for the muimaster function 'MUI_MakeObject'. This is more are replacment
for some C defines and is in most cases too limited to be really usefull. The first parameter is
a number. The available numbers are defined in muidefs.lua (e.g. MUIO_Cycle). The meaning
of the following parameters depend on the class.

Example:

obj = mui.make(mui.MUIO_Checkmark, label)

mui.set(object, tag, value)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a wrapper for the intuition function 'SetAttrs'. This is for changing attributes of
objects. The first parameter is an object returned from mui.new or mui.make.

Example:

mui.set(window, mui.MUIA_Window_Open, true) or window:set(mui.MUIA_Window_Open, true)

intval = mui.getint(object, tag)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a wrapper for the intuition function 'GetAttr'. This is for querying of attributes
of objects. The result is returned as integer. Use this when the type of the attribute is
LONG, ULONG, BOOL etc.

Example:

count = slider:get(mui.MUIA_Numeric_Value)

strval = mui.getstr(object, tag)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Same as above, but returns a string. Use this when the type of the attribute is STRPTR, char * etc.

ptrval = mui.getptr(object, tag)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Same as above, but returns a light userdata. Use this when the type of the attribute is a pointer.

intval = mui.doint(object, method, ...)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

This is a wrapper for the intuition function 'DoMethod'. The result is returned as integer.

Example:
window:doint(mui.MUIM_Notify, mui.MUIA_Window_CloseRequest, true,
    app, 2, mui.MUIM_Application_ReturnID, mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit)

strval = mui.dostr(object, method, ...)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Same as above, but returns the result of 'DoMethod' as string. Only use this
function when the type of the attribute is a string.

ptrval = mui.doptr(object, method, ...)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Same as above, but returns the result of 'DoMethod' as light userdata. Use this when the
type of the attribute is a pointer.

id, signals = mui.input(app)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Calls the method MUIM_Application_Input and returns the return ID.
The second return value are the signals to use with mui.wait().

mui.wait(signals)
'''''''''''''''''

Lets the application sleep until a signals arrives.

Example for a message loop:

running = true
while running do
  id, signals = app:input()
  if id == mui.MUIV_Application_ReturnID_Quit then
    running = false
  elseif id == ok_id then
    app:request(window, 0, "Hint", "OK", "OK gadget has been clicked")
  elseif id == cancel_id then
    app:request(window, 0, "Hint", "OK", "Cancel gadget has been clicked")
  end
  if running then mui.wait(signals) end
end


retval = mui.request(app, win, flags, title, gadgets, text)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Wrapper for MUI_Request. Shows a requester.
app:     application object, can be nil
window:  window object, can be nil
gadgets: if you need more than one button separate them with '|' 
text:    you can use \n to separate lines. You must not use placeholdes like %d, %s,
         use string.format instead
retval:  1, 2, 3, ... 0 depending on the number of gadgets

Example:

result = app:request(window, 0, "Important hint", "OK|Cancel", "Lua rulez")

id = mui.makeid(4 digit string)
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Creates an ID value.

Example: 

id = mui.makeid("FKWN")


Functions in the strarray table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The strarray table allows you to create NULL terminated string arrays. This is something what
you define in C like: 'char *names[] = {"Foo", "Bar", NULL};'. Some MUI classes like Cycle gadgets
need this.

object = strarray.new( string1, string2 , ...)
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Creates a new string array from the strings which you give as parameters. The strings are copied.
The terminating NULL is added by this function.

Example:

names = strarray.new("Foo", "Bar")


muidefs.lua
-----------
This Lua library is placed in lua:lualib. You have to load it with 'require "muidefs". It adds a
lot of variables to the mui table.
Variables starting with 
* MUIC are class descriptors to use as first parameter for mui.new
* MUIO are class descriptors to use as first parameter for mui.make
* MUIM are methods for mui.doint, mui.dostr and mui.doptr
* MUIA are attributes
* MUIV are values


muifuncs.lua
------------
This Lua library defines some functions which make the creation and modifying of objects easier.
E.g. You can use mui.TextObject(...) instead of mui.new(mui.MUIC_TextObject, ...)


Known problems
--------------
* Even when you can see your Zulu application in Exchange you can't disable or quit it from Exchange.
  The reason is that the real application name is AmiLua.

* Some attributes need pointers to structures like fonts, screens etc. You can't use them as long
  there aren't functions to create them.
