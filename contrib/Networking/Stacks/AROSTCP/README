Below are brief instructions on how to configure and run AROSTCP under
native AROS. It is assumed that AROS has already been installed onto
hard disk.


Configuration
=============


ENVARC:SYS/Packages/AROSTCP
----------------------------
The first thing to be aware of is the AROS package file.  It allows AROS to
perform startup operations for software packages in a friendly manner.
The main file is ENV-ARC:SYS/Packages/AROSTCP which points to the installed
location of the AROSTCP package.

During boot AROS will call the file s/Package-Startup in the directory pointed
to by the AROSTCP package file to add its own path variables, etc.

If you have AROSTCP installled to a different location than
AROS:Extras/Networking/Stacks/AROSTCP you will need to alter this file.

ENVARC:AROSTCP-CONFIG
----------------------
If The ENV Variable "AROSTCP-CONFIG" is specified - it is used to find
the location of the database files that will configure AROSTCP.  If not
specified AROSTCP will default to it's 'db' subdirectory. From here
on this dir will be refered to as the AROSTCP-CONFIG dir.

This option is mostly of use to systems which boot from read only media,
or environments where a number of differing network configs may be
necessary.

DB/*
----
There are a number of files in the AROSTCP-CONFIG that need to
be changed using a text editor (eg. 'Editor', found in AROS's Tools
directory):

* hosts: At the end of the file, there is an entry for a computer/device
called "gateway". Change the IP address at the start of this line to
that of your actual gateway, eg. your router.

* netdb-myhost: In the 'HOST' line, change the IP address to the real
IP address of your computer. You will likely need to change the DOMAIN
entry to your own networks address (ie 192.168.0.) and also the NAMESERVER
entry to that of your real DNS server.  Multiple NAMESERVER lines can be
specified for networks which use them.

* interfaces: At the end of the file, there are configuration entries
for different network cards. Enable the entry for your network card by
removing the '#' from the start of one of the lines that begin with
"#eth0".  You will need to alter the IP address to the correct one for
your card, and optionaly specify a NETMASK.

If you're using a home network, and you don't know what values to use in
the 'hosts' and 'netdb-myhost' files, try running AROSTCP without
changing them. The default values might work in a lot of cases.


Usage
=====

###
To start AROSTCP, open a shell and type the following two commands:

 CD SYS:Extras/Networking/Stacks/AROSTCP
 Execute s/startnet

###
To stop AROSTCP, run the Status command in a shell to get its process
number, and then enter

 Break N

where N is the process number.

### 
If you have configured your db files in a differing location to the default (ie not the /db/ subfolder) then use

   SetEnv AROSTCP-CONFIG <path to modified files>
   
to enable AROSTCP to use it.  Please note that this must be done before launching AROSTCP.

ie.

   CD SYS:Extras/Networking/Stacks/AROSTCP
   Copy db SYS:NetConfig ALL
   SetEnv SAVE AROSTCP-CONFIG SYS:NetConfig/
 
 ..
 edit the files in SYS:NetConfig/ to suit your network
 ..

   Execute s/startnet

And AROSTCP will use your configuration on subsequent reboots (with no worry of it being overwritten during an update of your installation - unless ofcourse you reformat the partition ;P)
