- What is this?

  This directory contains patches against the gcc source tree. Patches follow 
  the same naming convention as the gcc releases, plus a trailing 
  "-aros.diff" (without quotes).

- What is and how to build a cross compiler for AROS?

  A cross compiler is a compiler able to produce binaries usable by a 
  "target" system, which however runs on a different system than the 
  target one. This is useful to speed up development, in case the 
  "host" system is faster than the "target" one, or if the "host" 
  system has any other advantages over the "target" one.
  
  In our case the target system is AROS, and to produce a crosscompiler 
  for AROS you need to go trough the following steps:
  
  1) Decide which patch you want to apply

  2) Download the archive to which the patch you chosed applies. You 
     can find such archives at one of the sites listed at 
     http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/releases.html
     
  3) Apply the patch 

  4) Prepare a build tree for gcc, so that you can then "configure" it
  
  5) Configure gcc like described in its documentation, but taking care
     of specifying the following parameters:
     
     --target=<cpu>-aros --enable-sjlj-exceptions --enable-long-long
     --with-headers=<path/to/AROS/headers> --with-libs=<path/to/AROS/libs>

     replace the various <...> with the proper values.
     
  6) Type "make" and then "make install", 
  
- IMPORTANT: to be able to build the compiler you need to have built the 
             linker and related utilities first. Such tools are part of the 
             "binutils" package, which is compilable for AROS out of the box
	     (no need for patches). Get the latest version from
	     http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/
	     
- IMPORTANT2: to be able to produce working AROS executables, you also
              need a tool named collect-aros, which is part of the 
	      AROS build system, and thus can be found, once AROS is 
              compiled, under bin/<host>-<cpu>/tools/ OR in the 
              AROS-SDK package downloadable from 
	      http://www.aros.org/download.php. Make sure that 
              collect-aros is in the PATH, so that the compiler can 
              access it.
