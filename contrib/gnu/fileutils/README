What is this?
 Directory contains a set off diffs and this file of 
instructions on how to obtain and build the gnu fileutils package 
for AROS.
 At this point I have only used a fully-built crosscompiler 
(see: AROS/contrib/gnu/gcc/README) to build this package.

Basic instructions:

fetch ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/fileutils/fileutils-4.1.tar.gz
tar -zxvf fileutils-4.1.tar.gz
cd fileutils-4.1
patch -p1 < ../fileutils-4.1-aros.diff
./configure --host=i386-aros
gmake

Using:

 All the executeables are in the src directory.

Todo:

- This is a very ugly set of diffs just to get the ball rolling. 
- The build breaks after making the executeables while it's trying to 
  generate the documentation.
- Some commands were left out at this point while some function issues 
  are worked out (i.e fork/exec).
- I need to consolodate the functions I hacked into the end of the .c 
  files that need them into at least  perhaps aros/function.c for 
  preperation at getting them added to the AROS libc.
- For some odd reason I get different executeable sizes sometimes. Most 
  of the time now they have reverted to being rather large.
- Trying to strip these commands renders them unuseable.
- The -nix option needs to be included someplace but I forget where.

People on the dev list were very helpful in the port of gnu which, which 
was basically a warmup for this. Thanks! :)
As usual, any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
