	I get a memory fault for the attached file foobar.c, if i execute the
	command indent -st --dont-break-procedure-type foobar.c
	If i write void bar (void) the error does not occur. Also the identing
	does not work correct for comments between the procedure declaration
	and the opening bracket, see procedure foo. This does only happen with
	the option --dont-break-procedure-type.

	BTW, I have one other problem to report.  This one I've actually known
	about for awhile, but hadn't thought to report it as the workaround is
	easy:

	int
	main (int argc, char **argv)
	{
	  /* The mostly-blank line following:
	   *
	   * Can cause trouble with indent if -sc is not used.
	   */
	  return 0;
	}


	If "indent -sc" is used, this file is not changed.  But indent without
	"-sc" removes the star on the blank line.  Worse, if indent -sc is used on
	the damaged file, the star is restored but then extra stars are added to
	the remaining lines. (So a cycle of "indent foo.c; indent -sc foo.c;
	indent foo.c; indent -sc foo.c" and on does progressively worse damage to
	the file.

	---

	Actually, it only removed a star on a blank line when it was the second
	line of the comment (this line is used to determine if something is a
	block comment or not). --Carlo

	* NEWS: Add note that nested functions are a GNU extension.

	* indent.c:
	Give force_nl the meaning it really has.  Then actually force a newline
	when it is set at the last place where we didn't.  This fixes the bug
	that under certain cicumstances a line wasn't broken where it should.

	This fixes an old bug, reported by <igorlord@alum.mit.edu> at the
	beginning of 2000.  Possible break points were skipped under
	circumstances that did dependant on where a line was broken, resulting
	in an alternating output (after subsequent runs of indent).
	This was a hard one to find :/

	From: Jim Rogers <jimrogers@writeme.com>

	I don't expect the -di option to apply to function declartions when -npsl is
	used. for example, if -npsl and -di16 is used:

	void            main()
	{
	}

	--

	I think he is right and I changed this behaviour.  However, it does not
	work for nested functions: those are still indented.

	* args.c: Date: Wed, 12 Apr 2000 15:07:58 +0200
	From: "Borkhuis, Johan" <Johan.Borkhuis@peektraffic.nl>

	The defaults are read from the struct pro. For boolean types there are 2
	entries in this table, the positive and the negative (with an n in front).
	One of the items in the struct is p_special. This items is used to indicate
	if a the value of a boolean should be inserted as a default or not. But this
	does not work. The code as it is now (in the current 2.2.5 release) in the
	function set_defaults:

	  for (p = pro; p->p_name; p++)
	    if (p->p_type == PRO_BOOL || p->p_type == PRO_INT)
	      *p->p_obj = p->p_default;

	To get this to work the code should be changed to:

	  for (p = pro; p->p_name; p++)
	    if ((p->p_type == PRO_BOOL) && (p->p_special == ON) || p->p_type == PRO_INT)
	      *p->p_obj = p->p_default;

	Here a check if p_special is set to ON is inserted to check if this value
	may be used as a default.

	'-no-tabs' or '-nt' which lets you alter the default behavior.

	Subject: Yet two patches
	To: indent@runaway.xs4all.nl

	Hello!

	Since I'm hacking GNU Indent anyway...

	1) Using low-level I/O for backup files is not justified, decreases
	portability (especially create() and 0666) and may affect execution speed
	(since it's not buffered).
	backup.diff fixes it.

	2) Since GNU Indent has good chances to be portable across all platforms
	(especially after the above fix), it is a good idea to use AC_EXEEXT and
	AC_OBJEXT. Those macros are not very robust now, but they still simplify
	the life on DOS-derived OS'es.
	configure.diff adds them.

	Best wishes,
	Pavel Roskin

	Subject: patch for --cdb
	To: indent@alinoe.com

	Here is a patch to "fix" -cdb.   According to comments.c

	   `comment_delimiter_on_blankline' ("cdb"):  If set, place the comment
	       delimiters on lines by themselves.  This only affects comments
	       which are not to the right of code.

	Unfortunately, the code doesn't seem to successfully take the presence
	or absence of preceeding code into account.
	$ cat /tmp/x.c
	int foo; /* This is a single line comment */
	/* this is a column zero real single line comment */
	   /* this is elgible for cdb.  */
	$  ./indent -st -cdb /tmp/x.c
	int foo;                        /*
	                                   This is a single line comment
	                                 */
	/* this is a column zero real single line comment */
	   /*
	      this is elgible for cdb.
	    */


	With this patch installed, it returns:

	$  ./indent -st -cdb /tmp/x.c
	int foo;                        /* This is a single line comment */
	/* this is a column zero real single line comment */
	   /*
	      this is elgible for cdb.
	    */

	Though this specific example might look silly, it's very useful for
	cases where you're closing up a chain of loops and have

	                                        } /* loop of l */
	                                } /* loop of k */
	                        } /* loop of j */
	                } /* loop of i */

	I have made a modification (included as the output of "diff -c" which
	allows zero padding of numbered backup suffixes, controled by an
	environment variable, VERSION_WIDTH.

	If the variable is set to a positive integer, that width will be used to
	zero-pad the backup suffix, e.g. if VERSION_WIDTH=2 the suffix would be
	~01~ instead of ~1~.

	This improves alphabetical listing (with ls or a file requestor) when
	there are more than 10 backup versions. It may sound like overkill, but
	I have my text editor set to create a numbered backup with every save,
	and often there are more than 10 (even 20 or 30).

	- changes (c) to @copyright{};
	- uses more specific markup, including the new Texinfo 4.0 markup:
	  @file, @option, @command, @env, etc., in preference to @samp and
	  @code, where applicable;
	- changes spacing and page breaks to be a little more readable in the

	From: malekith@ikar.mps.com.pl
	Date: Thu, 26 Aug 1999 15:06:10 +0200 (CEST)
	To: indent@runaway.xs4all.nl
	Subject: Additional C++ support in indent (diff)

	What have I done?

	1. I removed -c++ arg check from indent.c, since it didn't work anyway (try)
	and put into args.c. I think you put it in indent.c because you wanted
	different set of options for C++, an I right? But for now ...

	2. In io.c I changed compute_label_target() func. Now if in_decl and
	c_plus_plus it returns one indent level back for labels, e.g.
	[...deleted...  this is still broken --Carlo ]

	3. I've added second set of keywords and hash func. This is in lexi.c.
	Lack of ``try'' keyword is intended. It caused errors (nested stmts or
	something). I couldn't handle this.

	4. Added recognizing GNU C++ >? and <? operators (and not documented >?= and
	<?=). It won't harm anyone since in normal C++ there can't be such
	combination of characters.

	5. I don't know why, but if colon is in_decl it is treated strange way.
	If c_plus_plus is set I changed this to handle ``public:'' and so on.

	Note from Carlo Wood:

	That is because in declarations you can have:

	  int foo:4;

	etc. In order to distinguish this from 'public:' etc, I am now
	testing for the 'i' (of the 'int') before treating the colon special.

	Removed memcpy.c.
	Should compile with a K&R compiler again now.

	Thanks to Kaveh R. Ghazi for report:

	        The following are some patches I needed to get indent-2.1.1
	working on SunOS4 using cc.  A couple of notes:

	1.  You may wish to use the AM_C_PROTOTYPES macro from automake-1.4.
	It'll define PROTOTYPES in config.h if they are available.  I had the
	test in sys.h check for it assuming you would use it when I defined
	the PARAMS macro to handle prototypes.

	2.  The way memcpy is handled seems like overkill.  You do
	AC_CHECK_FUNCS and define it to bcopy if not there.  You also call
	AC_REPLACE_FUNCS.  You also hard code including memcpy.c in the
	sources.  It seems to me that doing just the first check and defining
	it in sys.h is enough.  Get rid of the REPLACE check and the file
	memcpy.c file.

	3.  If you insist on prototyping free() for some reason, at least
	check whether the system already defines it for you.  I ran into
	conflicts with SunOS defining it to "extern int free()" and your
	source did "extern void free()" which bombed.  You can find various
	ways of doing this, egcs-1.1.2 has a NEED_DECLARATIONS check which
	works well.

	4.  If you insist on using ANSI style function definitions, you should
	do it everywhere and use automake's ansi2knr option for older systems.
	Until then, I un-ANSI-fied the inconsistent places where it appeared.

	* regression/standard/const.c, regression/const.c, regression/TEST, indent.c, indent.h, parse.c:
	Detect the `const' qualifier more reliable.
	Thanks to bug report by Lars Hecking.

1999-07-16  Carlo Wood  <carlo@ansset>

	* configure.in, sys.h:
	Don't combine memmove and memcpy detection: SunOS 4.1.4 doesn't have
	memmove, according to Nico Kadel-Garcia.

	* configure.in: Bumped version number to 2.1.2

1999-07-15  Carlo Wood  <carlo@ansset>

	Added `@dircategory' as per suggestion of Albert Chin-A-Young.

1999-07-09  Carlo Wood  <carlo@ansset>

	* io.c, sys.h:
	Renamed SYS_READ to INDENT_SYS_READ because of a name collision on HPUX.

	* configure.in: Bumped version number to 2.1.1

1999-07-04  Carlo Wood  <carlo@ansset>

	the global operator, member selection operators, and before subscripting,
	function calls and value constructions (all left brackets thus)).
	Also assigned a rough priority to them to keep the members of higher
	prioritized binary operators together.
