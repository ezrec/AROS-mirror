	o	Make this list shorter :)
	o	X windows screen saver version idea:
			calculate big mandelbrot.
			then using autopilot select good point
			display smaller rectangle(320x200) and make
			zoom to this point inside.
			Do this repeativly for more points.then you
			will get main mandelbrot with more zoom
			windows. Select most interesting one.
			Make it big again.
			and repeat :)
			Easy! isn't it?
	o	Add another interfaces than ugly interface?
	o	more ports of course..
	o	video seqencess saving. Make support for creating 
		movie file with saved movements and possibly calculated
		points. This should make very small movie files with
		aporox 1113 points for one frame. 500kb=500 frames=25
		minutes of animation with compression about 50%(runlength
		or lzo library) about one hour of animation in 320x200
	o	automatic recalculation of videos for other resolution 
		or configuration. Because movie filles will require 
		exactly same optimalisations and movements as they 
		were created. 
Please contact me if you want to do something from this long todo :)
