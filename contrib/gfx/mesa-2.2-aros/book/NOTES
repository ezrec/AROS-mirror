Notes on book demos

These samples were written by SGI and can be found in the OpenGL
Programming Guide.  They are also available by anonymous ftp from
sgi.com (opengl/opengl.tar.Z).

Minor bug fixes have been made to some files.

#include <stdio.h> was added to many files.

See the README file for copyright information.
