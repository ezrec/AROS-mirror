+
+  Wherever possible, Netpbm handles customization via the make files
+  instead of via this file.  However, Netpbm's make file philosophy
+  discourages lining up a bunch of -D options on every compile, so a 
+  #define here would be preferable to a -D compile option.

+   POSIX foo() subroutine might do something different from the X/Open
+   foo() subroutine).  Plus, this forces the coder to understand upon
+   what feature sets his program relies.
+
+   But some C library developers have misunderstood this and think of these
+   macros like the old __ansi__ macro, which tells the C library, "Don't 
+   have any features that aren't in the ANSI standard."  I.e. it's just
+   the opposite -- the macro subtracts features instead of adding them.
+
+   This means that on some platforms, Netpbm programs must define
+   _POSIX_SOURCE, and on others, it must not.  Netpbm's POSIX_IS_IMPLIED 
+   macro indicates that we're on a platform where we need not define
+   _POSIX_SOURCE (and probably must not).
