OpenGL 1.2 features and notes
-----------------------------

New texture sampling edge clamping:  GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE
	- not tested

glDrawRangeElements()
	- is implemented but not optimized

Packed pixel formats
	- not tested

3-D texture mapping as standard feature
	- tested OK

Separate specular color interpolation
	- tested OK, updated spectex.c demo



New extensions
--------------

GL_EXT_rescale_normal
	- tested OK

GL_SGIS_multitexture
	- demos/multitex.c tested OK

	*** WARNING *** this extension will soon be obsolete in favor
	of GL_ARB_multitexture.  Use at your own risk!!!

GL_EXT_multitexture
	- demos/multiext.c tested OK

	*** WARNING *** this extension will soon be obsolete in favor
	of GL_ARB_multitexture.  Use at your own risk!!!

GLX_SGI_video_sync extension
	- a no-op



Performance improvements
------------------------

glDrawPixels is generaly faster.  GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE GL_RGBA,
GL_RGB and GL_COLOR_INDEX images should expecially be faster.*

glReadPixels optimized for GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_RGBA format.*

glCopyPixels should be a little faster.*

Faster texture mapping when using 16bpp X window

Faster textured triangles in many cases thanks to Marten Stromberg

Faster dithered X TrueColor triangles.*

*Performance improvements somewhat depend on the class/depth of framebuffer.



Distribution changes
--------------------

glaux/gltk libraries no longer included or supported

New distribution arrangement:
	MesaLib-X.X.tar.gz	- Mesa GL and GLU libraries only
	MesaDemos-X.X.tar.gz	- GLUT, demos, utility files, etc.

Unix/X11 information removed from README and put into README.X11

GLUT version 3.7 now included



Source code directories
-----------------------

The source code for each Mesa driver is now found in a separate subdirectory.
For example, src/FX/, src/Windows/, src/DOS/, etc




Driver interface changes  (dd.h)
--------------------------------

Functions to read/write color/index spans/pixels all changed.
Now pass colors as GLubyte[][4] arrays instead of separate red, green, blue
and alpha arrays.  glDrawPixels is faster now.

New buffer clear function:  the Driver.Clear() function can now clear
color, depth, stencil, and accum buffers.  The Driver.ClearDepth() and
Driver.ClearColorAndDepth() functions were removed.

Added ExtensionString() function to device driver.  Now, each device
driver can advertise its own set of extensions.  Only used by 3Dfx
driver at this time.

Add GetParameteri() function to device driver.  Used to query device
driver for maximum texture size.  Will be used for other device queries
in the future.

Texture driver functions modified for multitexture extension




Demos
-----

Old "book" demos updated with OpenGL 1.1 / GLUT-based versions from Mark
Kilgard's GLUT distribution.

New demos:  demos/multitex.c demos/multiext.c


Conformance testing
-------------------

See CONFORM file for details.
