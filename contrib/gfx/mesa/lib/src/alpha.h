 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.1  2005/01/11 14:58:30  NicJA
 * AROSMesa 3.0
 *
 * - Based on the official mesa 3 code with major patches to the amigamesa driver code to get it working.
 * - GLUT not yet started (ive left the _old_ mesaaux, mesatk and demos in for this reason)
 * - Doesnt yet work - the _db functions seem to be writing the data incorrectly, and color picking also seems broken somewhat - giving most things a blue tinge (those that are currently working)
 *
 * Revision 3.1  1998/03/28 03:57:13  brianp
 * added CONST macro to fix IRIX compilation problems
 *
 * Revision 3.0  1998/01/31 20:44:19  brianp
