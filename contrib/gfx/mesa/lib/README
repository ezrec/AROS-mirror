Introduction
============

While Mesa uses the OpenGL API and mimics its semantics, it is
important to understand that Mesa is not a real implementation of OpenGL
since it is not licensed and has not been tested by the OpenGL conformance
tests.  That said, Mesa is still a viable alternative to OpenGL.

Since version 2.0 Mesa implements the OpenGL 1.1 API specification.
Since version 3.0 Mesa implements the OpenGL 1.2 API specification.

Only a few features are not yet implemented:

	trimmed NURBS
	polygon antialiasing


The primary design goal of this library has been correctness.  Common
code paths are optimized for speed.  If you find that a particular
rendering operation is slow let me know about it.  It may be a simple
matter to optimize the operation in question.

I've been working on this library in my spare time since August, 1993.
The core library was originally written on an Amiga using the DCC compiler.
Later, development was moved to an SGI workstation.  Current development
is done on SGI and PC/Linux systems.

Mesa works on most Unix workstations with ANSI C and X11.  There are also
drivers for Amiga, Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, MS DOS, NeXT, and BeOS
systems.  Look below for more information.

Since the OpenGL API is used, OpenGL documentation can serve as the
documentation for Mesa's core functions.  Here are a few sources:

  WWW Center:   http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL/
  Man pages:    http://www.digital.com:80/pub/doc/opengl/
  Spec doc:     http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL/glspec/glspec.html



Getting the software
====================

The primary Mesa ftp site is iris.ssec.wisc.edu in the pub/Mesa directory.
Mesa is also mirrored on sunsite in the directory pub/packages/development
/graphics/mesa.

As of version 2.3, Mesa is distributed in two pieces:  main library code
and demos.  If you're upgrading from a previous version of Mesa or you're not
interested in the demos you can just download the core Mesa archive file.

Mesa is available in three archive formats:

1. GNU zip/tar

	Download MesaLib-3.0.tar.gz and optionally MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz
	Unpack with:
		gzcat MesaLib-3.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
		gzcat MesaDemos-3.0.tar.gz | tar xf -

	If you don't have gzcat try zcat instead.

2. Unix compressed/tar

	Download MesaLib-3.0.tar.Z and optionally MesaDemos-3.0.tar.Z
	Unpack with:
		zcat MesaLib-3.0.tar.Z | tar xf -

GLUT
====

Mesa 2.5 and later includes Mark Kilgard's GLUT library (GL Utility Toolkit).
GLUT is built automatically on systems which support it.

The GLUT tests, demos, examples, etc are not included, just the main library.
To obtain the latest complete release of GLUT please visit
http://reality.sgi.com/employees/mjk_asd/glut3/glut3.html



Compiling and Installation
==========================

See the appropriate README.* file for system-specific instructions:


	System				README file
	-----------------		------------
	Unix/X11			README.X11
	Windows 95/N%			README.WIN32
	DOS				README.DOS
	Linux/Windows w/ 3Dfx hardware	README.3DFX
	Linux with GGI			README.GGI
	Linux with threading		README.MITS
	Amigas with Amiwin		README.AMIWIN
	BeOS				README.BEOS
	LynxOS				README.LYNXOS
	SciTech MGL			README.MGL
	IBM OS/2			README.OS2
	Windows w/ S3 Virge hardware	README.VIRGE
	VMS				README.VMS


Header and library files:
   After you've compiled Mesa and tried the demos I recommend the following
   procedure for "installing" Mesa on Unix systems.

   Copy the Mesa include/GL directory to /usr/local/include:
	cp -r include/GL /usr/local/include

   Copy the Mesa library files to /usr/local/lib:
	cp lib/* /usr/local/lib

	(actually, use "cp -d" on Linux to preserve symbolic links)

   Create a few symbolic links so that compiling OpenGL applications is easy:
	cd /usr/local/lib
	IF USING STATIC (lib*.a) FILES THEN
		ln -s libMesaGL.a libGL.a
		ln -s libMesaGLU.a libGLU.a
	ELSE
		ln -s libMesaGL.so libGL.so
		ln -s libMesaGLU.so libGLU.so
	ENDIF


Configuration options:
   The file src/config.h has many parameters which you can adjust such
   as maximum number of lights, clipping planes, maximum texture size,
   etc.  In particular, you may want to change DEPTH_BITS from 16 to 32
   if a 16-bit depth buffer isn't precise enough for your application.
   After changing config.h you must recompile Mesa.



Using the Library
=================

Performance Tips:
   1. Turn off smooth shading when you don't need it (glShadeModel)
   2. Turn off depth buffering when you don't need it.
   3. Turn off dithering when not needed.
   4. Use double buffering as it's often faster than single buffering
   5. Compile in the X Shared Memory extension option if it's supported
      on your system by adding -DSHM to CFLAGS and -lXext to XLIBS for
      your system in the Make-config file.
   6. Recompile Mesa with more optimization if possible.
   7. Try to maximize the amount of drawing done between glBegin/glEnd pairs.
   8. Use the MESA_BACK_BUFFER variable to find best performance in double
      buffered mode.  (X users only)
   9. Optimized polygon rasterizers are employed when:
         rendering into back buffer which is an XImage
         RGB mode, not grayscale, not monochrome
         depth buffering is GL_LESS, or disabled
         flat or smooth shading
         dithered or non-dithered
         no other rasterization operations enabled (blending, stencil, etc)
  10. Optimized line drawing is employed when:
         rendering into back buffer which is an XImage
         RGB mode, not grayscale, not monochrome
         depth buffering is GL_LESS or disabled
         flat shading
         dithered or non-dithered
         no other rasterization operations enabled (blending, stencil, etc)
  11. Textured polygons are fastest when:
         using a 3-component (RGB), 2-D texture
         minification and magnification filters are GL_NEAREST
         texture coordinate wrap modes for S and T are GL_REPEAT
         GL_DECAL environment mode
         glHint( GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT, GL_FASTEST )
         depth buffering is GL_LESS or disabled
  12. Lighting is fastest when:
         Two-sided lighting is disabled
         GL_LIGHT_MODEL_LOCAL_VIEWER is false
         GL_COLOR_MATERIAL is disabled
         No spot lights are used (all GL_SPOT_CUTOFFs are 180.0)
         No local lights are used (all position W's are 0.0)
         All material and light coefficients are >= zero
  13. XFree86 users:  if you want to use 24-bit color try starting your
      X server in 32-bit per pixel mode for better performance.  That is,
      start your X server with
         startx -- -bpp 32
      instead of
         startx -- -bpp 24
  14. Try disabling dithering with the MESA_NO_DITHER environment variable.
      If this env var is defined Mesa will disable dithering and the
      command glEnable(GL_DITHER) will be ignored.


Debugging:
   Normally Mesa records but does not notify the user of errors.  It is up
   to the application to call glGetError to check for errors.  Mesa supports
   an environment variable, MESA_DEBUG, to help with debugging.  If MESA_DEBUG
   is defined, a message will be printed to stdout whenever an error occurs.

   More extensive error checking is done when Mesa is compiled with the
   DEBUG symbol defined.  You'll have to edit the Make-config file and
   add -DDEBUG to the CFLAGS line for your system configuration.  You may
   also want to replace any optimization flags with the -g flag so you can
   use your debugger.  After you've edited Make-config type 'make clean'
   before recompiling.

   In your debugger you can set a breakpoint in gl_error() to trap Mesa
   errors.

   There is a display list printing/debugging facility.  See the end of
   src/dlist.c for details.


Fortran bindings:
   Fortan bindings are no longer included with Mesa.  William F. Mitchell
   (william.mitchell@nist.gov) has developed a new set of Mesa/OpenGL and
   GLUT bindings for Fortran.  See http://math.nist.gov/f90gl for more
   information.


Off-screen rendering:
   Mesa 1.2.4 introduced off-screen rendering, a facility for generating
   3-D imagery without having to open a window on your display.  Mesa's
   simple off-screen rendering interface is completely operating system
   and window system independent so programs which use off-screen rendering
   should be very portable.  This new feature effectively enables you to
   use Mesa as an off-line, batch-oriented renderer.

   The "OSMesa" API provides 3 functions for making off-screen renderings:
   OSMesaCreateContext(), OSMesaMakeCurrent(), and OSMesaDestroyContext().
   See the Mesa/include/GL/osmesa.h header for more information.  See the
   demos/osdemo.c file for an example program.   There is no facility for
   writing images to files.

   If you want to generate large images (larger than 1280x1024) you'll
   have to edit the src/config.h file to change MAX_WIDTH and MAX_HEIGHT
   then recompile Mesa.  Image size should only be limited by available
   memory.


Profiling:
   Mesa 1.2.6 introduced a simple profiling facility.  It counts and
   measures the time spent in a number of important rendering operations
   and prints the information in a report before your program exits.

   By default, profiling is disabled.  To enable it, add -DPROFILE to
   the appropriate CFLAGS entry in the Make-config file, then recompile
   Mesa.  In general, you should only enable profiling during program
   development to gain insight into Mesa's performance.  Mesa runs a bit
   slower when profiling is enabled because it requires frequent polling
   of the system clock.

   The profiling report will be printed when glXDestroyContext is called
   _if_ the MESA_PROFILE environment variable is set.  You must be sure
   glXDestroyContext is called before exiting to get the profile report.
   The report will be printed to stdout and includes:

      glBegin/glEnd - number of glBegin/glEnd pairs called, total time,
         and rate in pairs/second.
      vertexes transformed - number of vertices transformed, lit, clip-
         tested, fogged, and mapped to window coordinates, total time,
         and rate in vertexes/second.
      points rasterized - number of points drawn, time, and rate.
      lines rasterized - number of lines drawn, time, and rate.
      polygons rasterized - number of polygons drawn, time and rate.
      overhead - time between glBegin/glEnd not accounted for by vertexes,
         points, lines, and polygons.  This is time spent executing
         glVertex, glNormal, glColor, etc, clipping, primitive assembly,
         and user code between glBegin/glEnd.
      glClear - number of glClears executed, total time and clears/second.
      SwapBuffers - number of swaps executed, total time and swaps/second.

   Note that the real point, line, and polygon rates should be computed by
      adding in the vertex transformation and overhead time factors.


Linux SVGA driver:
   Mesa 1.2.6 has a preliminary Linux SVGA driver for Mesa.  It's based
   on the SVGA library included with Linux.  The driver isn't finished
   yet.  I'm not too familiar with SVGA graphics so I could use some help
   finishing it.  Contact Brian if you want to help.

   To enable the SVGA driver, edit the Make-config file and add -DSVGA to
   the CFLAGS for Linux and add -lvga to the LIBS variable.  There are
   several test programs (vtest.c, vgears.c, vindex.c) in the demos
   directory.  See the include/GL/svgamesa.h and src/svgamesa.c files for
   more information about the driver.


Extensions:
   The following OpenGL extensions are currently implemented:

      GL_EXT_blend_color - allows blending with a constant color
      GL_EXT_blend_minmax - blend min/max operator
      GL_EXT_blend_logic_op - allows glLogicOp to work in RGBA mode
      GL_EXT_blend_subtract - blend subtraction operator
      GL_EXT_polygon_offset - polygon Z offset
      GL_EXT_vertex_array - vertex array extension
      GL_EXT_texture_object - texture objects
      GL_EXT_texture3D - 3D texture mapping
      GL_EXT_paletted_texture - for color indexed textures
      GL_EXT_shared_texture_palette - shared texture palette
      GL_EXT_point_parameters - point parameters as a function of Z
      GL_EXT_rescale_normal - rescale normal vectors
      GL_EXT_abgr - GL_ABGR pixel format
      GL_SGIS_texture_edge_clamp - limit texture filtering to texture edge
      GL_EXT_multitexture - multitexture extension (Be warned:  this extension
         will be replaced in the future by GL_ARB_multitexture)
      GL_SGIS_multitexture - multitexture extension (Be warned:  this extension
         will be replaced in the future by GL_ARB_multitexture)

   For detailed information about the extensions see www.opengl.org
   Other OS-specific extensions are documented in the other README.* files.

   There are a few Mesa-specific extensions:

   GL_MESA_window_pos

      This extension adds the glWindowPos*MESA() functions.  These functions
      are convenient alternatives to glRasterPos*() because they set the
      current raster position to a specific window coordinate, bypassing the
      usual modelview, projection and viewport transformations.  This is
      especially useful for setting the position for glDrawPixels() or
      glBitmap() to a specific window coordinate.

      X and Y parameters (positive and negative) are directly mapped to
      window coordinates.  Z is a depth value clamped to the range [0,1].
      W is directly mapped.  The current raster position valid flag is
      always set to true.  The current raster distance is set to zero.
      The current raster color and texture coordinate are updated in the
      same manner as glRasterPos().  In selection mode a hit record is
      always generated.

      Programs using OpenGL, not Mesa, may also use the glWindowPos*MESA()
      functions by including winpos.h from the src directory and by
      compiling and linking with the winpos.c file from the src directory.

   GL_MESA_resize_buffers

      This extension adds the glResizeBuffersMESA() function.  When this
      function is called, Mesa checks if the color buffer (window) has
      been resized.  If it has, Mesa reallocates the ancillary (depth,
      stencil, accum) buffers.

      Normally, Mesa checks for window size changes whenever glViewport()
      is called.  In some applications it may not be appropriate to call
      glViewport() when the window is resized.  Such applications should
      call glResizeBuffersMESA() instead so the ancillary buffers are
      correctly updated.

      This extension is new in version 2.2.

Mailing List
============

There is a Mesa mailing list.  Its purpose is to let Mesa users exchange
any ideas, questions, and/or problems they have.  To subscribe, send the
following message to the address mesa-request@iqm.unicamp.br

    add yourname@your.internet.address mesa

For example:

    add brianp@elastic.avid.com mesa

You will receive a welcome message from the list server when you have been
added to the list.

To unsubscribe from the list send the following message to
mesa-request@iqm.unicamp.br

    del yourname@your.internet.address mesa

Thanks to Pedro Vazquez (vazquez@iqm.unicamp.br) for setting up and
maintaing the list.



WWW Page
========

There is a Mesa WWW page:  http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html



Contributed code
================

There is a contrib/ subdirectory on the Mesa ftp site which contains
contributions from Mesa users.  See the README file in that directory for
more information.

Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project, provided you
agree to the GNU license.

If you're contribution code to the Mesa library itself:
   1. Try to write clean code (uniform indentation, comments, meaningful
      identifiers, etc).  It must be readable and maintainable!
   2. Test your code.  On several occations I've incorporated code from
      users which later turned out to have bugs.  Now, I'm pretty hesitant
      to use code which doesn't look good.

If you're contributing changes to Makefile or Make-config be sure your
changes won't cause headaches for other users.  If you're not sure then
maybe a new config target is appropriate.



Reporting Bugs
==============

If you think you've found a bug in Mesa first check if a newer version of
Mesa is available.  Next, check ftp://iris.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/Mesa to see
if a patch for your bug is there.  Otherwise, report the problem.

Since many people have contributed code to Mesa it's important that you
report a bug to the right person:

However, they have been pretty helpful so far.

When you report a bug please give as much information as possible including
your hardware/software environment, which version of Mesa you're using, how
to reproduce the problem, and if possible, a test program.



Known Bugs
==========

1. Evaluator automatic normal vectors are miscalculated under certain
   conditions.

2. glCopyPixels gives undefined results when source and destination regions
   overlap and pixel zoom!=1.0.

3. Mesa doesn't work too well on Crays.  The problem is that Crays do not
   have the exact C data type sizes which Mesa's X driver relies on.  Better
   Cray support may or may not be seen in the future.

4. gluCylinder, and probably other GLU quadrics, don't generate texture
   coordinates when drawing in point or line mode.

5. NURBS code does not copy user supplied data as it should; it just
   stores pointers to that data. For the moment all data must be valid and
   available utill the gluEndSurface() or the gluEndCurve() call.



Future Plans
============

1. Integrate Mesa into the XFree86 X server and support more 3D hardware

2. Further optimizations for AMD 3Dnow!, MMX, etc.

3. Establish a new Mesa WWW site, ftp site and archive maintainer



Why is it the library called Mesa?
==================================

Why not?  More obvious names were considered but had to be rejected:
FreeGL (too similar to the trademarked name OpenGL), Free3D (too similar
to DEC's Open3D).  Also, I'm tired of acronyms.
