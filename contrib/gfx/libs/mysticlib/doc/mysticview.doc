    NAME
        MV_CreateA  - create a mysticview instance.
        MV_Create   - varargs stub for MV_CreateA.

    SYNOPSIS
        mysticview = MV_CreateA(screen,rastport,taglist)
        d0                      a0     a1       a2

        APTR MV_CreateA(struct Screen *,struct RastPort *,struct TagItem *)

        APTR MV_Create(struct Screen *,struct RastPort *,...,TAG_DONE)

    FUNCTION
        This function creates a viewer instance for a given screen and
        rastport.

    INPUTS
        screen      - pointer to the Screen for the viewer to appear on.
        rastport    - pointer to the RastPort for the viewer to appear on.
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems. most of these
                      attributes are both available to this function and
                      to MV_SetAttrsA(). there are only few attributes that
                      can only be passed to MV_CreateA() for initialization:

    TAGS
        MVIEW_Priority (ULONG) - task priority for the viewer's background
                task. valid range: -128...127. do not set this priority
                unless you have a good reason to and know exactly what you
                are doing, and better do not set this priority above your
                own task's priority.
                default: the caller's task priority.

        MVIEW_RPSemaphore (struct SignalSemaphore *) - pointer to
                an initialized SignalSemaphore, being obtained for
                each access to the view's underlying RastPort.
                locking the RastPort is mandatory if you want to
                share it between tasks, so you MUST supply this tag
                if you want to draw ANYTHING to the same RastPort
                as the view's background task. (v4) example:
                
                struct SignalSemaphore rastlock;
                InitSemaphore(&rastlock);

                mview = MV_Create(screen, rastport, 
                   MVIEW_RPSemaphore, &rastlock, ...);
                
                MV_DrawOn(mview);
                
                ...
                
                /* your drawing here: */
                
                ObtainSemaphore(&rastlock);
                
                SetAPen(rastport, pen);
                Move(rastport, ...);
                Draw(rastport, ...);
                
                ReleaseSemaphore(&rastlock);
                
                ...
                
                MV_Delete(mview);
                
                note: the view's background task tries to hold
                locks on the semaphore as short as possible, and
                it frees the lock as often as possible, even for
                very short time spans. try to be as fair as the
                view.

    RESULTS
        mysticview - the mysticview instance created, or NULL if
                     something went wrong.

        only the tags that are exclusively available to MV_CreateA()
        are listed here. refer to the documentation of MV_SetAttrsA()
        for all other tags.

                MUST NOT be deleted when it is the current picture of
                a mysticview instance. delete the viewer first, or set
                MVIEW_PICTURE to NULL before. default: NULL

                MVPREVMODE_GRID
                      when the image scrolls, scales or rotates, or 
                      when the visible dimensions change, the image
                      is first drawn as a grid, and then rendered with
                      highest quality.

                MVPREVMODE_OPAQUE
                      when the image scrolls, scales or rotates, or 
                      when the visible dimensions change, the entire
                      image is first drawn as a quick and dirty
                      preview, and then rendered with highest quality.

                default: MVPREVMODE_NONE

        MVIEW_ReadySignal (ULONG) - signal bit that will be submitted

                default: the screen's aspect.

        MVIEW_ShowCursor (BOOL)
                display an image cursor. default: FALSE

        MVIEW_StaticPalette (BOOL)
                use the same static palette for any picture instead of a
                dynamic one. this will result in a faster display at
                lower quality. skipping from one picture to another
                causes less flickering with a static palette.
                default: FALSE (dynamic palettes are used)

        MVIEW_Text (char *) - a single line of text to be displayed
                at the bottom of the picture's area inside the RastPort.
                the text will be copied to the mysticview instance and

        MVIEW_XPos (ULONG)
        MVIEW_YPos (ULONG)
                horizontal/vertical position inside the image. this is a
                fixed-floatpoint integer. the upper 16 bit determine the
                integral part of the number, the lower 16 bit determine the
                fraction. valid range is from 0 to 1.
                default is 0.5 (0x00008000)

        MVIEW_Zoom (ULONG) - zoom factor. this is a fixed-floatpoint
                integer. the upper 16 bit determine the integral part
                of the number, the lower 16 bit determine the fraction.
                valid range is from 0.1 to 10. default is 1 (0x00010000)
        
        MVIEW_DrawArrows (ULONG) - boolean to indicate that small
                arrows are to be drawn to the view's borders, when a
                picture is not fully visible. default: FALSE (v4)
        
        MVIEW_ShowPip (ULONG) - boolean to indicate that a PiP
                view of the current picture is to be displayed.
                this feature is considered experimental (v4).
                better do not use it. default: FALSE (v4)
        
        MVIEW_TextColor (ULONG) - 0x00rrggbb value for displaying
                text (see MVIEW_Text attribute). default: white.
                (v4)
        
        MVIEW_MarkColor (ULONG) - 0x00rrggbb value for displaying
                highlighted display elements, such as arrows, grid
                lines and the PiP frame. defaut: bright green.
                (v4)
        
    RESULTS
        none

    NAME
        MV_SetViewRelative - perform relative movement of the picture

    SYNOPSIS
        MV_SetViewRelative(mysticview,newx,newy)
                           a0         d0   d1

        void MV_SetViewRelative(APTR,LONG,LONG)

    FUNCTION
        This function performs a relative movement of the mysticview's
        current picture.
        
        in this example, we assume that you want to allow the user to
        drag the picture around with the mouse. proceed as follows:
        
        - on a MOUSEBUTTON / SELECTDOWN event, call MV_SetViewStart()
          with the mouse coordinates related to this event. call
          ModifyIDCMP() to catch MOUSEMOVE events now.
        
        - while dragging (thus, by receiving MOUSEMOVE events), pass
          the mouse coordinates to the mysticview instance via
          MV_SetViewRelative(). this will position the visible part
          of the picture. attributes like zoom, displaymode, rotation,
          aspects, etc. are fully considered.
        
        - when receiving a MOUSEBUTTON / SELECTUP event, call
          ModifyIDCMP() and disable MOUSEMOVE events. (There is no
          need for your application to be burdened with a continous
          flood of mouse movement events.)

    INPUTS
        mysticview  - pointer to a mysticview instance.
        newx        - new x coordinate
        newy        - new y coordinate

        void MV_SetViewStart(APTR,LONG,LONG)

    FUNCTION
        This function sets that starting coordinate for
