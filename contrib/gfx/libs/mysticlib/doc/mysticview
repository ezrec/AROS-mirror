        MV_CreateA  - create a mysticview instance.

@{b}    FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function creates a viewer instance for a given screen and
        rastport.

@{b}    INPUTS@{ub}
        screen      - pointer to the @{"Screen" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:intuition/screens.h/Main" 132} for the viewer to appear on.
        rastport    - pointer to the @{"RastPort" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:graphics/rastport.h/Main" 53} for the viewer to appear on.
        tags        - pointer to an array of TagItems. most of these
                      attributes are both available to this function and
                      to @{"MV_SetAttrsA()" Link "MV_SetAttrsA()"}. there are only few attributes that
                      can only be passed to MV_CreateA() for initialization:

@{b}    TAGS@{ub}
        MVIEW_Priority (ULONG) - task priority for the viewer's background
                task. valid range: -128...127. do not set this priority
                unless you have a good reason to and know exactly what you
                are doing, and better do not set this priority above your
                own task's priority.
                default: the caller's task priority.

        MVIEW_RPSemaphore (struct @{"SignalSemaphore" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:exec/semaphores.h/Main" 39} *) - pointer to
                an initialized @{"SignalSemaphore" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:exec/semaphores.h/Main" 39}, being obtained for
                each access to the view's underlying @{"RastPort" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:graphics/rastport.h/Main" 53}.
                locking the @{"RastPort" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:graphics/rastport.h/Main" 53} is mandatory if you want to
                share it between tasks, so you MUST supply this tag
                if you want to draw ANYTHING to the same @{"RastPort" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:graphics/rastport.h/Main" 53}
                as the view's background task. (v4) example:
                
                struct @{"SignalSemaphore" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:exec/semaphores.h/Main" 39} rastlock;
                InitSemaphore(&rastlock);

                mview = MV_Create(screen, rastport, 
                   MVIEW_RPSemaphore, &rastlock, ...);
                
                MV_DrawOn(mview);
                
                ...
                
                /* your drawing here: */
                
                ObtainSemaphore(&rastlock);
                
                SetAPen(rastport, pen);
                Move(rastport, ...);
                Draw(rastport, ...);
                
                ReleaseSemaphore(&rastlock);
                
                ...
                
                MV_Delete(mview);
                
                note: the view's background task tries to hold
                locks on the semaphore as short as possible, and
                it frees the lock as often as possible, even for
                very short time spans. try to be as fair as the
                view.

                MVPREVMODE_GRID
                      when the image scrolls, scales or rotates, or 
                      when the visible dimensions change, the image

        MVIEW_StaticPalette (BOOL)
                use the same static palette for any picture instead of a
                dynamic one. this will result in a faster display at
                lower quality. skipping from one picture to another
                causes less flickering with a static palette.
                default: FALSE (dynamic palettes are used)

        MVIEW_Text (char *) - a single line of text to be displayed
                at the bottom of the picture's area inside the @{"RastPort" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:graphics/rastport.h/Main" 53}.

                horizontal/vertical position inside the image. this is a
                fixed-floatpoint integer. the upper 16 bit determine the
                integral part of the number, the lower 16 bit determine the
                fraction. valid range is from 0 to 1.
                default is 0.5 (0x00008000)

        MVIEW_Zoom (ULONG) - zoom factor. this is a fixed-floatpoint
                integer. the upper 16 bit determine the integral part
                of the number, the lower 16 bit determine the fraction.
                valid range is from 0.1 to 10. default is 1 (0x00010000)
        
        MVIEW_DrawArrows (ULONG) - boolean to indicate that small
                arrows are to be drawn to the view's borders, when a
                picture is not fully visible. default: FALSE (v4)
        
        MVIEW_ShowPip (ULONG) - boolean to indicate that a PiP

@{b}    NAME@{ub}
        MV_SetViewRelative - perform relative movement of the picture

@{b}    SYNOPSIS@{ub}
        MV_SetViewRelative(mysticview,newx,newy)
                           a0         d0   d1

        void MV_SetViewRelative(APTR,@{"LONG" Link "TEXT_INCLUDE:exec/types.h/Main" 35},LONG)

@{b}    FUNCTION@{ub}
        This function performs a relative movement of the mysticview's
        current picture.
        
        in this example, we assume that you want to allow the user to
        drag the picture around with the mouse. proceed as follows:
        
        - on a MOUSEBUTTON / SELECTDOWN event, call @{"MV_SetViewStart()" Link "MV_SetViewStart()"}
          with the mouse coordinates related to this event. call
          @{"ModifyIDCMP()" Link "intuition/ModifyIDCMP()"} to catch MOUSEMOVE events now.
        
        - while dragging (thus, by receiving MOUSEMOVE events), pass
          the mouse coordinates to the mysticview instance via
          MV_SetViewRelative(). this will position the visible part
          of the picture. attributes like zoom, displaymode, rotation,
          aspects, etc. are fully considered.
        
        - when receiving a MOUSEBUTTON / SELECTUP event, call
          @{"ModifyIDCMP()" Link "intuition/ModifyIDCMP()"} and disable MOUSEMOVE events. (There is no
          need for your application to be burdened with a continous
          flood of mouse movement events.)

@{b}    INPUTS@{ub}
        mysticview  - pointer to a mysticview instance.
        newx        - new x coordinate
