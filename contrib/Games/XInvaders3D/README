History:
-=-=-=-=-

1.3.6:
		Minor fixes.
		Changed some game text which had the wrong
		contact information.
		Made some more code clean ups.

1.3.5:
      Moved all game text to gtext.h. 
      Removed `goto' in init code.
      Put a space in ``game over.'' 

1.32-1.34:
      Minor fixes.

1.31:
      Fixed drawing order. Objects were being drawn in reverse.

1.3:
      Many thanks to Thomas Boutell, he has contributed a 
      Windows port of XInvaders 3D. See README.win for more
      information. 

      XInvaders 3D DOS port finished. XInvaders 3D will now run
      as a full-screen 640x480x8 DOS game. For windows users it 
      will run in a DOS window just fine. I used DJGPP+Allegro
      to port it. See README.dos for more information.

      Added Vector-fonts. All text graphics have been
      replaced with Vector-fonts. Gives the game a
      cleaner look.

      New player blinking routine. Player now cycles
      through red colors, rather than being drawn
      each alternate frame, when a new level
      has been started.

      New special effect: 1-UP indicator. When 7500pts
      have been reached a new life is indicated by
      a nice little vector 1-UP floating towards
      the player.

      New alien-shoot missile routine. Aliens now shoot
      more.

      New Distance-of-Point-to-Line routine, used for
      collision detection. 

      Added fix for FreeBSD systems, thanks to Peter da Silva.

      Fixed ZONE_HEIGHT bug in game.c, which was generating 
      bad pointers, thanks to Sam Bushell.

      Cleaned up code, for portability reasons, thanks to
      Thomas Boutell for his help.

      Left-Shift key is no longer being used. 

1.2: 
      Cleaned up some more code. 

      Adjusted formation movement.

      Changed missile color to yellow, suggested by Mattia Engdeg.

      Fixed some warnings which the pedantic flag generates,
      thanks to Jarmo Pussinen for pointing them out.

1.1:  
      Fixed incompatible pointer warnings.

      Fixed window manager bug which Bill Kendrick pointed out.

      Windows were opening at an odd width and height under
      the Enlightenment Window manager.

1.0:
      Initial release.
