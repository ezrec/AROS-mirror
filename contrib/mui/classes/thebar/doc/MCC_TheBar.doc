    TheBar.mcc is a MUI custom class which provides facilities to
    generate a dynamic graphical toolbar for MUI applications. Beside
    standard toolbar-like functionality it allows to remove/add
    buttons dynamically as well as hiding/disabling them on the fly.

    In addition, TheBar allows to load all kind of images, even images
    with 32bit alpha-channel information via the standard AmigaOS
    datatype system.

    It is released and distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
    General Public License (LGPL) and available free of charge.

    Please visit http://www.sf.net/projects/thebar/ for the very
    latest version and information regarding TheBar.mcc

    For some short introduction on how to use TheBar.mcc and its
    associated sub-classes, the following pharagraph should provide a
    good summary. What you usually want to do with TheBar is, to
    enable your MUI application to display a toolbar with embedded
    images and allow the user to press a gadget.

    However, before we start going in detail, please read the
    following important notes on what you should definitly avoid in
    your application:

    1) NEVER cache single button object pointers:

       That means, even if you are able to receive each point of a
       single toolbar button via MUIM_TheBar_GetObject, you should
       *never* cache them in your application to directly access them
       later on. So something like the following is NOT allowed at
       all:

       set(button,MUIA_Disabled,TRUE);

    2) NEVER remove/add a toolbar button yourself:

       The reason is, that only TheBar should maintain the internals
       of the buttons. So in case you want to remove a button from
       your toolbar, use e.g. MUIM_TheBar_Remove instead of directly
       trying to remove/adding a button via OM_REMMEMBER.

    3) NEVER use MUI's own attributes like MUIA_ShowMe:

       If you want to hide, remove or get a button to sleep please use
       the method TheBar provides and don't try to use e.g.
       MUIA_ShowMe directly on a button object. That really isn't
       supported and should be avoided.

    4) If you use TheBar in a virtual group (Virtgroup), use
       TheBarVirt.mcc instead.

    To summarize, please read the following documentation carefully
    and don't try to be smarter than what this documentation suggests.
    Especially if the included header files may contain attributes or
    methods that are marked with /* PRIVATE */, please take it
    seriously and don't try to use them in your own applications. They
    may automatically vanish without a further notice. They are only
    for internal use of TheBar itself.

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Active

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Active -- ULONG, [ISGN], v11


    FUNCTION
     This attributes can be used to query or set the ID of the
     currently active button in the toolbar with mutual
     excluding buttons involved.

     Note that you may have many mutual exclude groups: this
     attribute will always contain the ID of the last selected
     button.

    EXAMPLE
     To get the ID of the currently active button:

     -- cut here --
     ULONG id=0;

     get(toolbar,MUIA_TheBar_Active,&id);
     -- cut here --

    SEE ALSO

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Appearance

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Appearance -- struct MUIS_TheBar_Appearance, [..G.]


    FUNCTION
     Since version 19, the user is able to change the appearance
     of the object in the MUI preference. If you want to get the
     actual appearance you may use this attribute.

     struct MUIS_TheBar_Appearance
     {
       ULONG viewMode;
       ULONG flags;
       ULONG labelPos;
       ULONG dummy[2];
     };

     - viewMode contains MUIA_TheBar_ViewMode value

     - labelPos contains MUIA_TheBar_LabelPos value

     - flags is a combination of:

       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_Borderless
       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_Raised
       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_Sunny
       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_Scaled
       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_BarSpacer
       MUIV_TheBar_Appearance_EnableKeys

    EXAMPLE
     To get the currently set TheBar appearance:

     -- cut here --
     struct MUIS_TheBar_Appearance appearance;

     get(toolbar,MUIA_TheBar_Appearance,&appearance);
     -- cut here --

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Buttons

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Buttons -- struct MUIS_TheBar_Button *, [I...]


    FUNCTION
     Can be specified on creation time of the toolbar. It defines
     the initially set up toolbar buttons and their options.

     Takes an array of MUIS_TheBar_Button structures whereas the
     structure is definied as:

     struct MUIS_TheBar_Button
     {
       ULONG           img;
       ULONG           ID;
       STRPTR          text;
       STRPTR          help;
       ULONG           flags;
       ULONG           exclude;
       struct IClass   *_class;
       Object          *obj;
     };

     Where the fields meanings are:

       ULONG img
         The index of the brush image used by the button (0,...)
         or one of the special values:

         * MUIV_TheBar_End
           Ends a MUIS_TheBar_Button array. Must always be
           present at the end of the array.

         * MUIV_TheBar_BarSpacer
           Add a bar spacer

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonSpacer
           Add a spacer between two buttons

         * MUIV_TheBar_ImageSpacer
           Add a spacer with the image specified in
           MUIA_TheBar_SpacerIndex; if no spacer index was
           specified, a bar spacer is used.

       ULONG ID

         The id of the object; any value may be used, but if the
         button is in a mutual exclude group, it must be x, where
         x = 0,...,23. That also means that you may have up to 24
         total mutual exclude buttons in a single bar.

       STRPTR text
         The button label, max 32 chars long; it is copied!

       STRPTR help
         The button short-help (for bubble help); it is *NOT*
         copied!

       ULONG flags
         Can be used to set the type of button you need; a
         combination of:

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_NoClick
           The button doesn't react to user inputs

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Immediate
           The button is an immediate one

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Toggle
           The button is a toggle one

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Disabled
           The button is disabled per default.

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Selected
           The button is selected. Use MUIA_Selected to un/select
           the button, but if the button is in a mutual exclude
           group, you SHOULD use MUIA_TheBar_Active!

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Sleep
           The button is not created at all. See
           MUIM_TheBar_SetAttr

         * MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Hide
           The button is created, but it is not shown. NEVER use
           MUIA_ShowMe on buttons! See MUIM_TheBar_SetAttr

       ULONG exclude
         Allows to specify a mutual exlusive mask to link up to 24
         button together. The mask must be specified as a bit
         operation of the type 1<<x where x = 0,...,23 is the ID of
         the button it the mutual exclude mask

       struct IClass *_class
         If you want to subclass TheButton.mcc to add drag'n drop
         or whatever, place the pointer to your class here: TheBar
         will know how to recreate your buttons correctly. Please
         note, that this must be a pointer to a BOOPSI class. So
         if you subclass from within an mcc you will have to use
         the address of the mcc_Class pointer in struct MUI_CustomClass.

       Object *obj
         This will be filled after the creation of the bar with a
         pointer to the button. Remember not to cache it. Just
         get it and use it.

    EXAMPLE
     The following code will create a toolbar with two mutual
     exclusive toolbar buttons.

     -- cut here --
     struct MUIS_TheBar_Button buttons[] =
     {
       ...
       { 0, 4, "_Matches", "Matches page.", MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Selected,  1<<5 },
       { 1, 5, "_Edit",    "Edit page.",    MUIV_TheBar_ButtonFlag_Immediate, 1<<4 },
       ...
       { MUIV_TheBar_End, -1, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, NULL, NULL },
     };

     Object *toolbar = TheBarObject,
                         ...
                         MUIA_TheBar_Buttons, buttons,
                         ...
                       End;
     -- cut here --

     MUIA_TheBar_Columns -- ULONG, [ISGN], v11


    FUNCTION
     This attributes defines the number of the columns of the
     bar. Setting this attribute to a value greater than 0, makes
     the bar act in a so called "columns mode".

     Default: 0.

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_DisMode

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_DisMode -- ULONG, [I...], v12


    FUNCTION
     Allows to define how disabled buttons should be rendered
     in case no own image set is available for it.

     One of the following values:

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_Shape
         Draws only a B/W shape to show the disabled status

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_Grid
         Draw a light grid in front of the image

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_FullGrid
         Draw a full grid

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_Sunny
         Converts the image into a greyscale image and
         displays it

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_Blend
         The disabled image is somehow blended. It requires a true
         color image with an active alpha channel and a system capable
         to render it.

       MUIV_TheBar_DisMode_BlendGray
         As the above, but rendered as gray.

    NOTE
     This overwrites the user preferences and so must be used
     wisely. If in doubt, don't use it.

     The default is:

     - If MUIA_Group_Horiz is TRUE the bar can freely grow
       in horizontal direction, but is limited vertically.

     - If MUIA_Group_Horiz is FALSE the can freely grow
       in vertical direction, but is limited horizontal.

    NOTE
     The setting of MUIA_Group_Horiz changes the
     max size of the bar.

       ULONG reserved[4];
     };

     The fields are:

      APTR data
       The image data, actually can be one of the following:

       * an UBYTE array of pens numbers, if BRFLG_ARGB is not
         specified in flags

       * an UBYTE array of true color data in the ARGB format, if
         BRFLG_ARGB is specified in flags; if you use the alpha
         channel A, specify BRFLG_AlphaMask in flags, otherwise
         it is ignored.

      UWORD dataWidth
       The width of the source image in pixels.

      UWORD dataHeight
       The rows of the source image.

      UWORD dataTotalWidth
       Total width of data in UBYTE.

      UWORD left
       The left offset of this pic in data in pixel; usually 0.

      UWORD top
       The top offset of this pic in data in pixels; usually 0.

      UWORD width
       The width of this pic in pixels; usually same as
       dataWidth.

      UWORD height
       The height of this pic in pixel; usually same as
       dataHeight.

      ULONG *colors
       The colors palette, actually can be one of the following:

       * an array of ULONG r,g,b left shifted triplettes, if
         BRFLG_ColorRGB is not specified in flags;

       * an array of ULONG 0x00rrggbb triplettes if
         BRFLG_ColorRGB is specified in flags;

       This is ignored if BRFLG_ARGB is specified in flags.

      ULONG numColors
       The number of the colors contained in colors, ignored if
       BRFLG_ARGB is specified in flags.

      ULONG trColor
       The transparent color, actually:

       * the pen index in colors, if BRFLG_ARGB is not specified
         in flags;

       * the 0x00rrggbb transparent color, if BRFLG_ARGB is not
         specified in flags.

       This is ignored id BRFLG_ARGB & BRFLG_AlphaMask are
       specified in flags.

      ULONG compressedSize
       If not 0, data contains byte run 1 compressed UBYTE, which
       are uncompressed on the fly and it is the size of the
       compressed data. Note that true color data are very bad
       compressed by byte run 1 compression.

      ULONG flags
       An bit mask with the following flags availabl:

       * BRFLG_ARGB
         Data are in ARGB format. See data;

       * BRFLG_AlphaMask
         Alpha channel in ARGB data is used. See trColor;

       * BRFLG_RGB8
         colors is in 0x00rrggbb format. See colors;


     If a pointer in the array equals to  MUIV_TheBar_SkipPic,
     it is skipped.

    NOTE
      As there are multiple ways of specifying images for the
      toolbar, the following list is the order of preference
      for TheBar:

       1. A disk based strip is opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Strip was
          specified

       2. Disk based pics are opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Pics was
          specified

       3. A ram based strip is used if MUIA_TheBar_StripBrush was
          specified

       4. Finally, ram bases pics are used, if MUIA_TheBar_Images
          was specifid

       5. If all of the above fails, the bar becomes a Text only one.

    FUNCTION
     Define the pixels between the bar and it's left frame.

     Accepted range is 0 < x <= 16

    NOTE
     This overwrites the user preferences and so must be used
     wisely. If in doubt, don't use it.

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Limbo

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Limbo -- BOOL, [.S..], v11


    FUNCTION
     That is a very strange one. You should use it with care and
     only if you really know what you are doing.

     Usually, it should be set to TRUE before the bar comes in
     InitChange and set to FALSE after the bar ExitChange.

     If it is TRUE and the bar gets a MUIM_Setup all the gfx
     stuff are not created, if the bar gets a MUIM_Cleanup the
     gfx stuff are not released.

     Very useful to drag the bar, to change its orientation and
     so on, without recreating all the gfx stuff (e.g. remapping
     the bitmaps).

    EXAMPLE

     Always do something like:

     -- cut here --
     set(bar,MUIA_TheBar_Limbo,TRUE);
     DoMethod(group,MUIM_Group_InitChange);
     ...
     ...
     ...
     DoMethod(group,MUIM_Group_ExitChange);
     set(bar,MUIA_TheBar_Limbo,FASE);
     -- cut here --

    FUNCTION
     Define the mininum wanted version of TheBar.mcc. If on
     creation of the object the minimum version wasn't found
     NULL will be returned.

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_MouseOver

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_MouseOver -- ULONG, [ISGN], v18

    FUNCTION
     If MUIA_TheBar_Raised or MUIA_TheBar_Sunny is TRUE,
     this attribute contains the id of the last button
     where the mouse was over.

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_NtRaiseActive

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_NtRaiseActive -- BOOL, [ISGN], v18

    FUNCTION
     If FALSE, a frame is drawn around borderless and
     sunny or raised buttons. If TRUE, no frame is
     used.

     Useful to active a button when the mouse is over
     and so change page in a page-mode group.

     Default: FALSE

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Pics

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Pics -- STRPTR *, [I...], v11

    FUNCTION
     Specify the images that will be used by the buttons of the
     bar.

     While with MUIA_TheBar_Images you specify an array of struct
     MUIS_TheBar_Brush ** , with this attribute you specify a NULL
     terminated array made of the names of the pics the bar will
     use.

     The pics will be loaded at the toolbar init time by using
     datatypes.library.

     If one picture/image can't be load for any reason, the whole
     toolbar is forced to text-only mode and MUIA_TheBar_TextOnly
     is set to TRUE.

    EXAMPLE
     Define a toolbar with two button images which are located
     in 'PROGDIR:images':

     -- cut here --
     static const char *images[] =
     {
       "Abook_Save",      // Save
       "Abook_Find",      // Find
       NULL
     };

     Object *toolbar = TheBarObject,
                         ...
                         MUIA_TheBar_PicsDrawer, "PROGDIR:images",
                         MUIA_TheBar_Pics,       images,
                         ...
                       End;
     -- cut here --

    NOTE
      As there are multiple ways of specifying images for the
      toolbar, the following list is the order of preference
      for TheBar:

       1. A disk based strip is opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Strip was

       2. Disk based pics are opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Pics was
          specified

       3. A ram based strip is used if MUIA_TheBar_StripBrush was
          specified

       4. Finally, ram bases pics are used, if MUIA_TheBar_Images
          was specifid

       5. If all of the above fails, the bar becomes a Text only one.

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_SpecialSelect -- BOOL, [I...], v12


    FUNCTION
     If TRUE, the buttons contents is moved to the right/bottom
     when the mouse is over it.

     Default: FALSE

TheBar.mcc/MUIA_TheBar_Strip

    NAME
     MUIA_TheBar_Strip -- STRPTR, [I...], v11


    FUNCTION
     Here you can define a filename which should be used for loading
     the button images. It must contain ALL images of ALL defined
     buttons. If for any reason the file can't be loaded, the whole
     toolbar is forced to text only and MUIA_TheBar_TextOnly is set
     to TRUE. MUIA_TheBar_PicsDrawer is also respected when loading.

     The number of the contained images in the strip is derived
     from:

     1. the value specified in MUIA_TheBar_StripButtons; this
        lets you add buttons later.

     2. the number of the buttons specified in
        MUIA_TheBar_Buttons (if supplied), spacers not included

    NOTE
      As there are multiple ways of specifying images for the
      toolbar, the following list is the order of preference
      for TheBar:

       1. A disk based strip is opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Strip was
          specified

       2. Disk based pics are opened, if MUIA_TheBar_Pics was
          specified

       3. A ram based strip is used if MUIA_TheBar_StripBrush was
          specified

       4. Finally, ram bases pics are used, if MUIA_TheBar_Images
          was specifid

       5. If all of the above fails, the bar becomes a Text only one.

     Tag attr     - the attribute of the notification to kill

     Object *dest - pointer to the object which will normally
                    receive the notification. Might be NULL as well
                    to delete all notifications for a specific
                    attribute/button combination.

    RESULT
     res - a boolean


    SEE ALSO
     MUIM_TheBar_Notify

TheBar.mcc/MUIM_TheBar_Notify

    NAME
     MUIM_TheBar_Notify, v21


    SYNOPSIS
     res = DoMethod(bar, MUIM_TheBar_Notify,ULONG ID,Tag attr,ULONG value,Object *dest,ULONG followParams,...);


    FUNCTION
     This is a method that works with the internal notification system
     for the toolbar. It works just like the normal MUI system for
     notifications, but handles an extra argument - ULONG ID.
     This is neccesary if you want to be able to give each button its
     own set of notification events.


    INPUTS
     ULONG ID     - the numerical button identifier

     Tag attr     - the MUI attribute to trigger the notify on. This may
                    be all kind of attributes allowed to the button, including
                    attributes such as MUIA_Pressed, MUIA_Selected,
                    and so on.

     ULONG value  - the value that triggers the notification. E.g. for
                    MUIA_Pressed that would be TRUE/FALSE. However, also
                    the special values like MUIV_EveryTime are supported.

     Object *dest - Object that should be notified. Special values like
                    MUIV_Notify_Self, MUIV_Notify_Window and
                    MUIV_Notify_Application are allowed as well.

     ULONG follow - the number of further paramters following this
                    one

     ...          - The following parameters. Here you can also use
                    the special value MUIV_TheBar_Qualifer if you need
                    to receive the key qualifiers being active at the
                    time when the notifies was triggered. In addition,
                    special values like MUIV_TriggerValue and
                    MUIV_NotTriggerValue are supported as well.


    RESULT
     In most cases this method will return TRUE. It is only the lack of
     memory that might cause a negative result.


    NOTE
     Even if it was possible to achieve the very same behaviour
     with directly applying MUIM_Notify on a button object, this
     method should generally be preferred to set a notification.


    EXAMPLE
     Sets a notify for MUIA_Pressed, which in fact is the action
     when a user clicked/activated the button.

     -- cut here --
     DoMethod(bar,MUIM_TheBar_Notify,1,MUIA_Pressed,FALSE,MUIV_Notify_Application,
                                       MUIM_CallHook,&buttonHook,1);
     -- cut here --

     As soon as the button is clicked, the application object will
     receive a MUIM_CallHook method which instructs it to call the 'buttonHook'
     with the actual qualifier flags being placed in its arguments.

      you can execute the following method and see button 5,1,3
      rearranged accordingly:

      -- cut here --
      DoMethod(bar,MUIM_TheBar_Sort,5,1,3,-1);
