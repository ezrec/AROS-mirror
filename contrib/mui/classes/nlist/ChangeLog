#### v0.103 RELEASE ###########################################################

2009-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.103 release preparations

2009-10-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.h: replaced the custom style definitions by official
    ones.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, docs/MCC_NList.doc: MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle was
    broken in several ways. Passing pos==MUIV_NList_Insert_Bottom did nothing
    instead of replacing the last entry, pos==MUIV_NList_Insert_Active chose
    the correct entry, but due to a missing "break;" statement that entry was
    discarded again and caused no replacement at all. Again thanks to Andreas
    Falkenhahn for the hint.
  * demo/NList-Demo#?.c: removed some unneeded includes.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: get()ting MUIA_Disabled always returned FALSE even
    for disabled lists. Thanks to Andreas Falkenhahn for the hint.

2009-09-19 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: added a name to all memory pools for OS4.

2009-09-17 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/german.ct, nlistviews_mcp/Makefile: added a german
    translation.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/german.ct: replaced the former german translation with
    a completely new one.

2009-09-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/misc: loaded all clipboard access stuff off to a separate process.
    Accessing the clipboard via iffparse.library requires 2 user signals for
    each instance and thus an application would run out of free signals sooner
    or later.
  * nlisttree_mcc/misc: applied the same changes as for NList.mcc and clipboard
    access.

2009-08-14 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Makefiles: added "-g" to the debug flags. It seems the OS3 GCC 2.95.3 cross
    compiler needs this to generate debug infos at all.

2009-06-16 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some APTR typecasts to fix several type pun
    warnings.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: replaced the hand crafted message for the embedded
    DoMethodA() call by a proper structure. This fixes a type pun warning.

2009-06-15 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Renamed francais.ct to french.ct, so that we have only English language names.
  * Added catalog creation to AROS metamakefiles
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: check variable "ln" to avoid a segfault.
    This happened in the NListtree demo when the button "GetNr" was pressed
    while no list entry was selected.

2009-06-15 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c: replaced the hand crafted clipboard accesses by
    proper iffparse.library calls. This circumvents the endian conversions and
    is much easier to understand.

2009-06-15 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * Made clipboard functions endiannes aware.

2009-06-08 Matthias Rustler <mrustler@gmx.de>

  * AROS metamakefiles added.
  * Added "ioreq.io_Message.mn_Length = sizeof(ioreq)" because
    console.device won't open without this on AROS.
  * Some fixes for 64-bit AROS
  * Re-added some fixes from previous AROS port.

2009-06-06 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: adapted the whole build system to compile all NList classes
    finally for AROS. Now everything should compile and link fine with an
    AROS cross-compiler and if everything works out fine the next NList
    release will come with AROS binaries.

2009-05-04 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/SDI_lib.h: updated to the latest version.

2009-05-03 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: use 16-byte AltiVec alignment to maximise software
    blitting performance on Pegasos and Mac Mini.

2009-05-02 Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * include/mccinit.c: RTF_EXTENDED was not set for the MorphOS build making
    revision number ineffective.

2009-04-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * updated the SDI headers to their latest fixed versions.

2009-04-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/Makefile: changed printf command to standard echo.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c: adjusted some variable type due to the recent
    changes in the OS4 SDK.

2009-04-20  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: changed all makefiles to also include the AROS targets. In addition
    the whole build environment has been attached to compile all of our mcc
    and mcp classes for AROS. Now all NList classes should at least compile
    and link fine for AROS. If they properly work has to be tested first. :)

2009-04-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * updated the SDI headers and mccinit.c to their latest fixed versions.

2009-03-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added missing MUI_DisposeObject() call for an
    Imagedisplay.mui object.

2009-01-30  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Makefile, nbitmap_mcc/Makefile: the OS4 build is now linked
    against newlib instead of clib2.
  * nlist_mcc/misc: added new tag MUIA_NList_IgnoreSpecialChars. This attribute
    accepts a NUL terminated string of characters to be ignored during string
    parsing. This is meant to be able to use special characters like 0xA0, which
    is used by some fonts (i.e. the Alpha character in some greek fonts). By
    default the 0xA0 character is used as a "non breaking space" and will be
    treated a such.
  * Makefile: removed the printf usage with the ANSI codes and replaced them
    by the more intuitive CC/LD echo output.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: completely rewrote the images shading. The class no
    longer grabs the already blitted images from the RastPort and applies a hand
    crafted alpha shade. Instead precalculated shade arrays are used and alpha
    blitted over the normal images. This speeds things up a lot.
  * nbitmap.c/misc: removed dependency on cybergraphics.library since everything
    is done via graphics.library now.
  * nbitmap.c/NBitmap.c, nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: the latest changes didn't
    respect a possibly changed border size during AskMinMax.

2008-12-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Makefile: modified Makefile to include the custom memory pool
    functions for OS2.x in the OS3 build only.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced some deprecated function calls by new
    ones for the the OS4 build.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c, nlist_mcc/cbio.c: replaced some deprecated function
    calls by new ones for the the OS4 build.

2008-07-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Pointer.c: reverted all AllocMem() calls back to AllocVec(). If chip RAM
    really is that precious, then a low chip memory situation will occur even
    before MUI is able to open a window with all bells and whistles enabled.
    Using AllocVec() instead of AllocMem() is really much more intuitive. Also
    made the color management for the pointer images OS2.x compatible by using
    GetRGB4() instead of GetRGB32(), which is OS3.x only. Although I really
    doubt anybody is still seriously using MUI 3.8+ on an OS2.x system in 2008.

2008-06-30  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * #?/Pointer.c: use MorphOS 2.0 system pointers. Also changed AllocVec()
    calls by AllocMem() to save precious chip ram.

2008-06-25  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/czech.ct: Updated to match the latest .cd file.

#### v0.102 RELEASE ###########################################################

2008-06-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: final v0.102 release preparations
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: forgot to return MUIA_Version and
    MUIA_Revision for checking the version application-wise.
  * nlistviews_mcp: replaced the calloc() and free() usage against AllocVec()
    and FreeVec() because the alloc function can't be used in shared libraries.
  * Makefile: added a top-level makefile for easily compiling all things in
    a row. Also added an "install" target

2008-06-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc: added a new MUIA_NBalance_Pointer attribute to enable/disable
    the custom pointer for a NBalance object.
  * nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: upon OM_SET our own tags will be set to TAG_IGNORE
    which should be more correct for tags parsing.

2008-06-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: changed the eventhandler's priority to -2 to make
    it called after Balance.mui's eventhandler. According to Jens this one has
    a priority of -1 and starts the balancing process after having received an
    IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE message. With pri 0 it could happen in some very rare cases
    that NBalance's eventhandler was called when the mouse pointer just left the
    object by one pixel and restore the standard pointer, but Balance.mui's
    eventhandler would start the balancing process from the very same message.
    Hence the balance process would happen with the standard mouse pointer
    instead of our custom one.

2008-06-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mui/NBitmap_mcc.h: fixed some strange characters which prevented
    a successful build.

2008-06-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: unified the global definitions for the attributes and
    variables to be taken from the global NBitmap_mcc.h file instead.
  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: changed the sizepointer image to be the very same as
    in the new NBalance class. This should make the whole custom pointer
    look&feel more consistent.
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: it seems I finally fixed the custom mouse pointer
    handling by using a correct logic of IDCMP_MOUSEBUTTONS|IDCMP_MOUSEMOVE
    events. Lets see how this performes in practice.

2008-06-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: removed the unneeded mouse button check as MUI
    doesn't broadcast any MUIM_HandleEvent messages any more as soon as some
    dragging or balancing has begun.
  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: fixed the "reappearing normal pointer" problem, at
    least most of the time it works. Sometimes the last move event right before
    the balancing process starts yields that the mouse is no longer over the
    object, while in fact it still is.

2008-06-14  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/NBalance.c: modified the mouse pointer show/hide functionality
    so that the custom mouse pointer is also shown when the balance object is
    being resized. This is, however, still not perfect because as soon as the
    resize operation is finished the custom pointer stays, which we need to
    solve before we can release a first version of the new NBalance class.

2008-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbalance_mcc/Pointer.c: fixed the wrong transparency of the horizontal
    pointer image.
  * nbalance_mcc: corrected the debug classes and simplified the setting
    of the different pointer images a little bit.

2008-06-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbalance_mcc: added sources of new custom class which enhances the standard
    mui MUIC_Balance custom class by adding a mouseover identification to show a
    different mouse pointer to signal that the mouse is over a balance object.
    In future we can even add new styles (look&feel) to this class to make it
    look more unique and how a balance object should look today.

2008-03-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/vastubs.c, #?/Makefile: added vararg stubs for OS3 to be able to link
    against clib2 which misses these stubs. Also added Lib#?Pooled()
    replacements which are missing in clib2 aswell.

2008-03-09  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale/swedish.ct: Updated according to changes.

2008-03-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: converted all TABs to spaces and cleanup the
    sources a bit.

2008-03-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/private.h: added missing variable

2008-03-07  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/Makefile, nlistviews/vastubs.c: added vararg stubs for
    certain functions to be able to links against clib2.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: the example text is localizable now. This
    fulfills feature request #1851580.

2008-03-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Makefile: removed -lm from the linker libs as nothing needs floating
    point math. Also added dump as target.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: replaced the shading factors by integers to avoid
    floating point math.

2008-02-19  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/WritePixelArrayAlpha.c: implemented WritePixelArrayAlpha() for
    M68k builds. Not very efficient but does its job.

2008-02-19  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * Debug.h: replaced all abort() usages in our ASSERT() macros with the
    respective calls to assert(). This should prevent the MorphOS compile
    from not linking and be a bit more intuitiv.

2008-02-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mccinit.c: updated to latest version available which fixes some
    MorphOS specific compiler warnings.

2008-01-28  Daniel Allsopp <daniel@the-snakepit.co.uk>

  * nbitmap_mcc: Fixed various layout and redraw errors introduced with 15.4
    and implemented button labels.

2008-01-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?_mcp/locale/#?.ct: changed all .ct file names to english names instead of
    translated ones.

2008-01-02  Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/czech.ct: Updated to match the latest .cd file.

2007-12-27  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c: no need to examine WhichLayer() on MorphOS 2.0
    because there custom pointers respect window borders.

#### v0.101 RELEASE ###########################################################

2007-12-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: last final release preparations.

2007-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp, nlisttree_mcp: added czech catalog generation to build
    makefiles.

2007-12-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c: the custom pointers will
    now only be shown if the mouse pointer is over the object AND over the
    object's window. If the window is partly covered by another window the
    normal pointer will be shown.

2007-12-12 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: the
    custom pointers will now be set and hidden in the Show/Hide methods. Hiding
    them in the Cleanup method is forbidden, because the necessary window is not
    existing anymore then.

2007-12-12 Vit Sindlar <sindlarv at centrum dot cz>

  * nlistviews_mcp, nlisttree_mcp: added czech catalog translation

2007-12-07 Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/icon.png: added example picture with alpha channel.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: added some debug output to track down transparency
    problems with OS3.

2007-12-07  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/NListtree_mcp.cd: fixed typo.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/english-british.ct: added, OS4 only for now.
  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: fixed version string, added the
    missing codeset, removed all the Localizer junk, fixed the artificial
    typo in MSG_HELP_SPECIAL_IMAGE.
  * ChangeLog: minor cleanup.

2007-12-06  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to changes.

2007-12-03  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/locale/NListtree_mcp.cd:
    reworked catalog descriptor from the ground up, now only help bubbles
    for the "Expand" and "Collapse" buttons are missing (hint :).

2007-12-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed some indentations.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: added missing includes and library definitions.

2007-12-01  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Updated according to the new .cd file.

2007-11-30  Ilkka Lehtoranta <ilkleht@isoveli.org>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap-Test.c: added simple test application for nbitmap.mcc.
    It requires icon.png file which is not included for copyright reasons.
  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed rendering bugs caused by my CGX patch.
  * nbitmap_mcc/dispatcher.c: removed obsolete MUI_RequestIDCMP()/MUI_RejectIDCMP()
    calls. Event handlers are used instead.

2007-11-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: moved the inclusion of the proto/#?.h files a few
    lines further down to avoid unnecessary warnings when compiling for OS3.
    The OS3 proto files don't seem to include the necessary stuff to define
    Bitmaps, etc, themself.

2007-11-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: integrated a patch kindly provided by Ilkka Lehtoranta
    which makes the bitmap class compile/link for MorphOS and OS3 as well.
    Now cybergraphics.library calls are used for all platforms instead of
    forcing the class to P96 only. Please note, however, that we still
    need a test application for that new class as currently the only
    application using that new class is Epistula and that's unfortunatly
    available for OS4 only :(. So we should at least put a NBitmap-Test
    app into our repository for testing it directly from here.

2007-11-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: added a copyright crawling object to the
    bottom of the mcp to match the Look&Feel to our other classes.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: reworked the whole mcp GUI to not fire up a
    sub window for the copyright and/or example listtree. In addition, the
    locale translation stuff now uses FlexCat instead of the old, obsolete
    and properitary Localizer stuff. However, new translation are now
    required.

2007-11-03  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Just upped the version number.

2007-11-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added all buttons to the cycle chain. This fixes
    bug #1824550.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added the missing control chars for the style and
    space sliders.

2007-11-02  David Rey <tactica@users.sourceforge.net>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: the URL in the Copyright window no longer
    points to an empty homepage (fixes bug #1824552), also updated the
    copyright dates and general indentation to make it more readable
  * docs/ReadMe: general rework and preparations for next release

2007-10-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: moved the MUI key handling
    to the HandleEvent() function, because this function can signal an "eaten"
    key press to MUI. The now empty HandleInput() function has been removed
    therefore. This fixes the strange folder listtree behaviour in YAM.
  * nlisttree_mcc/Debug.c, nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: refined the debugging
    flags a lot to get more detailed information.

#### v0.100 RELEASE ###########################################################

2007-10-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: for OS4 the normal bitmap data are now used for the
    fallback pointers in case the graphic card cannot handle 32bit hardware
    sprites as pointer.

2007-10-11  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nist_mcc/Pointer.c: the combinated bitplane is now also declared as constant
    data instead of "calculating" it.

2007-10-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: removed the DefaultObjectOnClick workaround for
    MUI3.8/m68k which is no longer necessary, as the corrent return of
    MUI_EventHandlerRC_Eat for handled mouse clicks inside the object also
    cured the "first click does not select" bug in YAM.

2007-10-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the MUIKEY_LEFT/RIGHT always ate the keyevent
    instead of just eating it in case NListtree itself reacted upon the key
    press. This prevented NListtree from being able to be horizontally scrollable
    in addition to reacting upon the new KeyLeft/RightFocus attributes.
  * nlist_mcc: implemented new MUIA_NList_KeyXXXFocus attributes which can be
    set to another object in the same window the NList object resists. In case
    the corresponding key action (Up/Down/Left/Right) is processed with no actual
    scrolling/changing action being performed, the selected object will become
    the new active object of the window.

2007-10-09  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: the inactive color is now also used if the list's
    window is inactive. That means the list AND the window must be active to
    let the list be drawn with its active colors.

2007-10-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: the new MUIV_NList_Redraw_Selected wasn't updating
    list objects which are in MUIV_NList_TypeSelect_Char mode.

2007-10-08  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: added new redraw type
    MUIV_NList_Redraw_Selected to redraw selected entries only. This new type
    is needed by the recently added (in)active highlighting.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the latest changes revealed another bug in NList
    when running under OS3. The HandleEvent method did not signal MUI that a
    mouse click was eaten and upon changing the active object MUI issued the
    same message again to the same object which in turn thought that the user
    did a double click on the listview. Fixed this bug by returning the correct
    value in this case. Caution: a similar effect may happen under different
    circumstances again! We really need to check when MUI_EventHandlerRC_Eat
    must be returned an when it must not!

2007-10-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: implemented a new MUIA_NList_ActiveObjectOnClick method which
    will not only make sure that upon clicking into an NList object, this
    object will become the currently active object of the window.
  * nlist_mcc, nlistview_mcc: the NListview class will now catch the GoActive
    and GoInactive methods of MUI and forward them to NList so that NList can
    react on the activation/deactivation of the objects and show different
    background colors for active and inactive listviews.

2007-09-23  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlistviews_mcp/locale: Added swedish translation for the new NListviews.mcp.
  * nlistviews_mcp/Makefile: Added swedish to the available translations.

2007-09-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: changed all background and foreground pen relevant sections to
    take note of the new upcoming inactive pen color configurable in NListviews.mcp
    now.

2007-09-17  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: too much data was copied while setting up the bitmaps
    for the pointers, which caused crashes with the OS3 build as soon as either
    the move or size pointer should be displayed. Also fixed a coloring issue
    with the size and move pointers.

2007-09-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: removed all stackchecking functionality regardless if we can compile
    them conditionally via DO_STACK_CHECK or not. It was about time to do a cleanup
    of NList and this should be a first step. Stack checking shouldn't really be
    required on any platform. And if so anything can be restored in one go by
    reverting this change via subversion (SVN).
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c: now that our new preferences also allows to enable
    disable the new char selection pointer we now check for the settings in NList
    as well.
  * nlistviews_mcp: reworked the whole preferences GUI and finally got rid of
    all the nonsense Misc1-MiscX register tabs. All the various options are now
    grouped together based on their purpose. In addition, the preferences GUI
    is now fully localized which should allow to generate translations for every
    language. All in all the whole preference program should have a more
    professional, clear and intuitive look&feel now like it should have been
    right from the start.

2007-09-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: hopefully fixed the "first click does not select"
    bug. This occured with MUI3.8/m68k only when two lists within one windows
    both have set MUIA_NList_DefaultObjectOnClick to TRUE. In this case the
    second, inactive list never gets activated on the first click. OS4 and
    MorphOS don't seem to be unaffected by this.

2007-09-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: added a note to MUIA_NList_StackCheck that this tag is
    a no-op from the next release on.
  * misc: removed the complete stack checking mechanism for various reasons.
    Fist, stack checking causes serious performance penalties. Compared to
    MUI's own List class NList class is quite slow and stack checking just
    makes things worse. Second, if the stack size for an application is too
    low it will very likely crash in other parts and not just while processing
    NList stuff. Third, when you got a warning requester before telling you to
    increase the stack size you did so just to get rid of that requester. This
    requester was shown if the free stack size dropped below a certain limit.
    By increasing the stack size the requester vanished, but there is no
    guarantee that the increased stack is really needed. The check is just a
    rough estimation without any calculated requirement which will be exceeded.
    Nevertheless, stack checking can be enabled again by compiling NList.mcc
    with DO_STACK_CHECK #define'd.

2007-09-13  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp: added a new 'Inactive' Pen and FrameSpec pop object for the
    upcoming inactive cursor color being introduced to e.g. NList itself. In
    addition, as the pointer color selections in now fully automatic the config
    item to manually select the black color has been removed - minor cleanups
    included.

2007-09-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c: fixed an issue where in case some other gadget/process
    set the window pointer to something else we might have ended up with the
    wrong or no custom pointer at all.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: in case a NList object is in the charwise selection
    mode a specialized selection pointer will now be shown instead of just
    showing the normal pointer image. This should make the charwise selection
    more obvious and intuitive and be in line what TextEditor.mcc now does as
    well.

2007-09-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/Pointer.c, misc: reworked the whole mouse pointer setup/cleanup
    routines from scratch and adapted them to use 32bit ARGB pointer images in
    case NList is compiled for AmigaOS4. In addition to black/white color setup
    works now all automatically like previously introduced in TextEditor.mcc.
    This whole thing should finally allow to remove the configuration for the
    pointer color in the NList configuration as well as showing a specialized
    select pointer in case the mouse is above a read-only floattext object.

2007-09-02  Pär Boberg <pbobbenb@spray.se>

  * nlisttree_mcp/locale/svenska.ct: Just bumped the version number to match
    v18.13 release of nlisttree.mcp.

2007-08-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: partly fixed bug #1172351 where due to consequtive
    DrawText() calls at the very same position the font display is messed
    up if the font is anti-aliased. The problem seems to be that not the entire
    background where the new text is drawn will be cleared right before executing
    the DrawText() function. However, due to the overlapping of italic text NList
    requires to also at least redraw one character before and after the char that
    should be initially redrawn. Unfortunately this isn't quite easy to achieve in
    the DrawLines() function as there doesn't seem to be a way to check the exact
    width of the pre/post-fixed char. Therefore only some additional space is
    cleared/redrawn as well (data->spacesize) which in fact isn't quite correct
    and ends up in still having a screwed up font display in case the user
    quickly selects/deselects over the vers same area if TypeSelect is set to
    charwise selection. More work is required here, but due to the ugly source
    code it would be hard to find/fix the issues quickly.

2007-08-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: added new MUIA_NList_AutoClip attribute which allows to disable
    the default behaviour of an NList object where in read-only (NoInput) mode
    when MUIA_NList_TypeSelect is set to select charwise, the content will be
    automatically copied to the clipboard. This should allow to set a NList object
    to comply with the Amiga styleguide where always Amiga+C should be used to
    manually copy the selected content to the clipboard.
  * nlist_mcc/NList-Test.c: added the sources of the NList demo as a new test
    application which will be directly linked against the NList objects and therefore
    allows to more easily/quickly test changes in the NList code.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.10 version

2007-08-16  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: translated a german comment to english and
    commented out two further lines which broke the build.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: upon MUIM_NListtree_Redraw only visible nodes are
    redrawn to avoid unnecessary overhead.

#### v0.99 RELEASE ############################################################

2007-07-25  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/library.c: now really uses the 3 parameter version of GETINTERFACE()
    defined in mccinit.c instead of the old obsolete version in mcc_common.h.
    The user definable functions (i.e. ClassInit()) must be declared before
    the inclusion of mccinit.c.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.8 version which really uses the
    GETINTERFACE() macro with 3 parameters.

2007-07-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.7 version

2007-07-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.6 version which fixes an unbalanced
    if statement.

2007-07-23  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.5 version which should take care
    of stack issues.

2007-07-12  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added platform dependend type definition of
    LocaleBase.

2007-07-05  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.4 version and adapted all our
    library.c files to make use out of the new stack enforcing mechanisms.

2007-07-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: added some more
    typecasts to the image generating functions to please GCC.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some typecasts to the debug output to
    please GCC.

2007-07-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: added some NULL pointer checks to the debug
    output.

2007-06-26  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: somehow the latest fixes for the bugs #1190788 and
    #1720456 didn't make it into the repository. Commited them again.
  * misc: removed all trailing "\n" of all debug macros, as these clutter the
    debug output.

2007-06-22  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * docs/MCC_NList.doc: added the necessary requirements for AutoCopyToClip to
    be working. The object must either be the window's active or default object.

2007-06-21  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c: the Class element of an IntuiMessage was assigned
    a non-zero value instead of checking it, which made NList.mcc to start
    dragging single items in certain situations. Now a correct check is done.
    This fixes bug #1627687.

2007-06-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: fixed bugs #1190788 and #1720456 by uncommenting a
    previously commented out line. If a line is now marked up to the right
    border and then copied to the clipboard the beginning of the following line
    will no longer be copied as well. Please check and report if this fix has
    any other negative side effect.

2007-06-15  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: the raw key conversion was completely broken
    due to the latest changes. Now a separate buffer is used which is appended
    to the hotkey string.
  * demo/Makefile.#?: fixed wrong include path.
  * nbitmap/dispatcher.c, nbitmap/NBitmap.c: replaced SetMem() calls by standard
    memset() calls, as SetMem() is OS4-only.
  * nbitmap/private.h: added missing declarations of the OS4 specific types
    int8/16/32 and uint8/16/32 to make NBitmap.mcc compilable for OS3 and MOS.
  * nbitmap/dispatcher.c: moved all variable definitions in front of the ENTER()
    macro.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func.c: added some range and NULL pointer checks to the
    MUIM_NList_GetSelectInfo method.

2007-06-14  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of strcpy() by strlcpy(). stpcpy()
    has been replaced by strlcat().
  * misc: replaced all remaining occurences of sprintf() by snprintf().

2007-06-13  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: unified the _DPRINTF() functions for all platforms.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: replaced all calls to sprintf() and strncat()
    by sizeaware calls to snprintf() and strlcat(). This effectively makes
    buffer overruns impossible. Additionally the buffer pointer no longer needs
    to be passed around to all functions.

2007-06-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * #?/Makefile: replaced all platform specific makefiles with a single
    platform flexible one which can be called by a simple 'make' call and
    automatically identify for which platform it should compile the mcc/mcp.
  * include/mccinit.c: updated to latest 1.1 version which should fix possible
    stack issues during the LibInit() phase. Custom libraries will now be opened
    during the LibOpen() phase instead while maintaining an own mutual exclusive
    locking variable.

2007-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccinit.c, mcc/library.c, mcp/library.c: replaced the old obsolete
    mccheader.c by the new mccinit.c which should come with a much more clear
    interface and documentation on how to use it for a basis of a MUI custom
    class. This should significantly reduce the possibility of race conditions
    in the mcc/library init code.

2007-05-29  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: added some const keywords.
  * include/mccheader.c: reworked the LibOpen() and LibClose() functions to
    increment/decrement the lib_Open counter before obtaining the semaphore to
    prevent a possible race condition with LibExpunge().

2007-05-02  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c: a wrong flag was used to signal a pending
    notification for MUIA_NList_DragSortInsert. Using the correct flag should
    fix bug #1668322.

2007-05-01  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: the GetEntry method didn't respect closed lists
    when counting then nodes and hence the first node of a closed list was
    always returned while the next node was skipped.

2007-04-24  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/NBitmap.c: fixed an aliasing break by replacing a DoMethodA()
    call by a varargs DoMethod() call.

2007-03-23  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c: fixed wrong final output of debug classes and flags.
  * #?/Debug.c: disabling a debug flag was not possible due to a check for the
    '!' at a wrong index.

2007-03-11  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added russian catalog translation kindly provided by
    Vlad Vinogradov.

2007-01-20  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some more sources to look a *lot* nicer.

2007-01-10  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc/misc: reworked some sources to look a *lot* nicer. Also added
    two new debugging classes "datatype" and "draw" to capture possible flaws in
    these areas.

2007-01-06  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nbitmap_mcc: added the sources of our new NBitmap.mcc custom class
    kindly developed and provided by Daniel Allsopp in 2006. Currently the class
    only compiles on AmigaOS4, but future versions should be ported to OS3 and MOS
    as well and should also be running on cybergraphics.library systems. This new
    class provides general purpose methods for loading/drawing all kind of bitmaps
    (either loaded from a file or dtObject) including methods for applying certain
    image modifications in advance. This class should also allow to load images
    which can contain alpha-channel masking like e.g. 32bit PNG files. All in all
    it should be the next generation MUI custom class for dealing with all kind
    of images and their operations/display.

#### v0.98 RELEASE ############################################################

2006-12-18  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * demo: added makefiles and made all our demos compile for all our different
    targets like OS3/OS4/MOS.

2006-12-17  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: applied a fix for certain tree open/close related problems
    kindly provided by Thomas Igracki. NListtree was previously adding certain
    items twice when opening a list tree. In addition if only a few items were
    part of a list tree certain items weren't correctly or at all displayed.

2006-12-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * misc: bumped versions for upcoming release and adapted
    makefiles to compile with -Wwrite-strings.

2006-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: changed all get() uses to xget() uses and also made sure
    that all attribute checking get() are directly using GetAttr().
  * nlist_mcc: minor changes to the makefiles so that the class is always
    compiled with function symbols turned on, no matter what.

2006-11-28  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp/local/svenska.ct: added swedish catalog translation kindly
    provided by PÃr Boberg.
  * nlisttree_mcp: moved the "locale" directory to here because each mcp
    should have its own directory instead of accessing a global one

2006-10-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc: transformed all "struct TimeVal" definitions into separate
    ULONG values as a real timeval structure is not really required. Also
    adapted the HandleEvent method to use the current time supplied by the
    intuimessage instead which should be more accurate.
  * includes/SDI_hook.h: updated to latest version and adapted our sources
    accordingly.

2006-10-07  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * #?/Debug.c/h: Ooops. Forgot to check in the debug sources... :(

2006-10-06  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: converted some left over old D(bug())'s.
  * misc: added new debugging scheme, as known from YAM and TextEditor.mcc.
    Therefore the now obsolete file includes/mcc_debug.h is gone. The
    debugging facility is far from perfect and yet just covers the absolute
    minimum of debugging. That means one cannot yet define precise debugging
    classes.

2006-10-04  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * includes/mccheader.c, #?/Makefile.os4: switched to newlib compilation and
    linkage per default.

2006-10-03  Thore Böckelmann <tboeckel@gmx.de>

  * misc: removed several signedness issues
  * nlisttree_mcc/Makefile.os4: added -D__NEW_TIMEVAL_DEFINITION_USED__ to
    CFLAGS
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c,h, nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: changed all
    usages of "struct timeval" to new "struct TimeVal" and all usages of
    "tv_secs" and "tv_micro" to "Seconds" and "Microseconds".
  * include/SDI_#?: updated SDI headers to very latest available versions
    which should fix compilation issues with VBCC and the VARARGS68K
    definition.
  * include/#?mui#?: updated MUI heards to very latest available versions
    which don't include any <clib/#?> directly anymore.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c: the code to return the current pixel length of a
    line didn't check for -1 as an invalid index and therefore caused crashes
    if the list was contained in a virtual group and was scrolled into view
    very slowly. -1 is the index of the title bar. This fixes bug #1568047.

#### v0.97 RELEASE ############################################################

2005-07-30  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c,NList_mcc2.c: modified wheelmouse aware source
    code to take respect of the new AmigaOS4 specific IDCMP_EXTENDEDMOUSE
    events supported since intuition.library v51.28+.

2005-07-02  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: added removed <proto/utility.h> include
    back as the OS4 SDK requires it for resolving CallHook() properly.

2005-06-24  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nfloattext_mcc/NFloattext.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (CopyText, mNFT_GetEntry): Use MEMF_ANY when allocating memory.
    (mNFT_Set, mNFT_GetEntry): Remove superfluous casts.
    (mNFT_GetEntry): Use CopyMem().
    (CopyText): Use strcpy().
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c (OpenClipboard/CloseClipboard): Fixed.
    (DoSuperNew, MyCallHook): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
    (MyCallHookA: Disabled since its unused.
    Use stdlib.h
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcc/QuickSort.c: Cleanup
    #include statements.
  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: minor cleanup.
  * nlistview_mcc/NListview.c: Cleanup #include statements.
    (DoSuperNew): Use SDI_stdarg.h.
  * nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlistview_mcc/Makefile.os4,
    nlistview_mcc/Makefile.mos (CFLAGS): Added -I.. to get rid of ".."
    in #include statement.
  * nlistviews_mcp/NListviews.c: Cleanup #include statements.

2005-06-23  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c: Removed LocaleBase and its interface
    definition.
    (_DisposeP): moved CloseCat() and CloseLocale() inside the
    "if (LocaleBase)" block.
  * nlisttree_mcc/library.c: Added LocaleBase defintions.
  * nfloattext_mcc/private.h, nlist_mcc/private.h, nlisttree_mcc/private.h,
    nlisttree_mcp/private.h, nlistview_mcc/private.h, nlistviews_mcp/private.h:
    Remove some unnessecary "../includes/". Use "" for private includes.
  * nlist_mcc/Makefile.os3, nlist_mcc/Makefile.os4, nlist_mcc/Makefile.mos:
    Added -I.. to get rid of ".." in #include statements.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_grp.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img.h, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.h:
    Minor cleanups.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc0.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc1.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c, nlist_mcc/NList4_mcc.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c, nlist_mcc/NList_mcc6.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_func2.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c, nlist_mcc/NList_func4.c,
    nlist_mcc/NList_grp.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img.c, nlist_mcc/NList_img2.c,
    nlist_mcc/move.c, nlist_mcc/library.c: Add #include statements for used
    headers.
  * nlist_mcc/private.h: Removed excessive header inclusion.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc3.c (xget): Initialize local variable. Remove unused
    MUIA_ #define.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc5.c: Removed xget() prototype.
  * nlist_mcc/protos.h: Added xget() prototype.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_func3.c (MyCallHookPktA): use SDI_stdarg.h.
  * nlist_mcc/NList_mcc.c (DoSuperNew): Likewise.
  * nlist_mcc/library.c: Make ioreq static.

2005-06-16  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * nlisttree_mcc/NListtree.c, nlisttree_mcp/NListtree.c: Unify MySPrintf
    for OS4 and MOS using SDI_starg.h as done by other projects.
    Fix OS3 MySPrintf for GCC 3.4.x or newer (has to use stdarg.h macros!)
    Initialize variable passed to GetAttr() with Zero.
    Includes cleanup.
    Fixed typos.

2005-06-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/SDI: updated SDI headers to latest incarnation.

2005-05-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * library.c: added missing USE_UTILITYBASE define which may have caused
    problems on OS3 machines.

2005-04-10  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * includes/mccclass_68k: replaced the assembler based OS4/68k stub by a
    easier manageable C-based variant.

2005-04-09  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: fixed case sensitive #include statements which broke the
    build on systems with a case sensistive filesystem.
  * includes/SDI*: updated the common SDI headers with latest
    version taken from the YAM repository.

2005-03-21  Gunther Nikl <gni@gecko.de>

  * all: Minor source cleanup.

2005-03-17  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree_mcc: Addressed bug 1095158 by rewritting the
    responsible parts. This might introduce other problems and
    needs proper testings.

2005-03-16  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed base page access which happened when no entry
    was selected and the keyboard was used (bug 1156362)

2005-01-01  Nicolas Sallin <henes@biclodon.com>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed wrong usage of MUI_MAXMAX

#### v0.96 RELEASE ############################################################

2004-12-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * made sure all revisions/dates are bumped of all NList classes
    for upcoming new NList release.

2004-12-15  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: On some circumstances MUIA_NList_InsertPositions was not
    set correctly if the element has been inserted via
    MUIV_NList_Insert_Sorted. Hopfully fixed now.

2004-12-14  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc: Fixed insert refresh problem

2004-12-13  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList_mcc:  Fixed offset refresh bug
  * NList_mcc, NListviews_mcp: Added new prefs option to disable
    the vertical centering of the text lines (can be found on the
    misc2 sub page)
  * NListviews_mcp: Eliminated a misc sub page. In the future the
    rest should be eliminated as well.

2004-10-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * include/mccclass_68k.S: updated mcc 68k->PPC cross call stubs to
    latest version created by fdtrans 51.1

2004-10-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>,
            Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * mccheader.c: Special Fun of Computing fix. Return value of
    PreClassInitFunc() was not evaluated.

2004-09-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: modified all makefiles to use "-W -Wall" as the warning
    level and adapted all source files accordingly. Reactivated
    the DEBUG options in all morphos makefiles aswell as the
    debugging options can be dynamically disabled on the
    commandline by "make DEBUG=" anyway.

2004-08-26  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: More changes for morphos.

2004-08-25  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NList4_func4.c: Fixed wrong disposion of mouse pointer
    objects. Bug found by Georg Steger.

2004-08-25  Nicolas Sallin <henes@morphos.de>

  * All: Changes for morphos.

2004-08-24  Sebastian Bauer <mail@sebastianbauer.info>

  * NListtree: Fixed alignment problems (the alignment enforcement
    surrounding include statements was discarded by subincludes).
    The events are now only subscribed between MUIM_Show/MUIM_Hide
    rather than MUIM_Setup/MUIM_Cleanup as otherwise MUI sends
    them even if the object is not showed (e.g. within a page).
    Frozen version 18.20 of NListtree.

2004-08-07  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc: fixed a rather annoying drawing bug where the
    NList class wasn't calculating the correct vertical start
    position on drawing the listview. This causes a very annoying
    "stutterting" when instantly resizing the NList surrounding
    group. However, this seems to trigger now another hided minor
    drawing bug where not all of the vertical space of the NList
    object is used. So this is something we have to look after
    aswell.

2004-07-27  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * mccheader.c: updated the general mcc source file to the
    latest version also used with other .mcc's out there. Also
    adapted all library.c files to define the USEDCLASSES stuff
    correctly.

2004-07-16  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * gcc3: adapted all sources to be more gcc3 compliant. Removed
    all remaining warnings in -Wall mode. Please note that at
    least for the AmigaOS4 port of the classes gcc 3.4.1 should
    be considered the default compiler now.

2004-07-03  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree_mcp: added the missing mcp class of the nlisttree
    class and ported it to native OS4 aswell.

2004-07-01  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * all: built some first OS4/PPC native versions of all classes
    and added makefiles for it accordingly.
  * all: fixed all remaining compiler warnings which occurred
    with -Wall.
  * all: updated and reorganized all NList classes to use the
    SDI_*.h header files to make it way easier to maintain the
    source code for different operating systems like OS4 and MOS.

2003-02-25  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: fixed bug in the Draw method were it could have
    happened that on a LAYERSREFRESH request the object wasn`t
    correctly refreshed.

2003-02-24  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * added USEDCLASSES and USEDCLASSESP to all NList related
    classes so that the preferences/superclass ordering is
    a bit more accurate.

2003-02-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NList.mcc: added new MUIV_NList_Insert_Flag_Raw flag to
    the MUIM_NList_Insert method. With this special flag the
    developer is able to insert a bunch of data into a NList
    without recalculating/reordering the columns width. As tests
    pointed out the most significant speed loss while inserting
    entries to a NList is the recalculating of the width of
    each column. So, if  a developer is sure that he doesn`t need
    to recalculate the columns width each time he inserts something,
    he can now specify this flag and those entries will be inserted
    with higher performance.
    Tests have shown that ~8000 elements can be inserted now within
    1-2 seconds instead of 8-9 seconds.
  * NListtree.mcc: replaced Insert/RemoveTreeNodeVisibleSort()
    functions by one ReplaceTreeNodeVisibleSort() function
    that calls MUIM_NList_ReplaceSingle instead. That speeds up
    the sorting of a treenode to a factor of ~170%.
  * NListtree.mcc: removed broken flashsort implementation
    as it anyway didn`t work correctly and wasn`t also
    the best one for that sorting purpose. Replaced it with
    a own Quicksort implementation and also use the same
    algorithm now for the 68k version. As some test showed
    the C implementation is as fast as the former ASM one and
    in addition we have more flexibility now.

2003-02-08  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * NListview.mcc: implemented similar MUIA_ControlChar support
    like the original Listview.mui supports it since ages.
    By specifying a MUIA_ControlChar for a NListview object it
    is now possible to specify a hotkey to control the active
    entry of the corresponding NList.

2003-01-07  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No default Compare Hook was set.

2002-12-31  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree/nlisttree.c: if a own ConstructHook was
    set via SetAttributes, the whole flags were deleted.
    Instead of a unset bit operation a masking operation
    was used which caused that whole flags screwup. Fixed.

2002-11-21  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlisttree: updated sources to conform better with newest
    morphos SDK.

2002-11-02  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: No longer copies the compare hook, instead
    it uses the pointer directly

2002-10-12  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc.c: fixed bug in the internal
    ConstructHook_String where Sensei forgot to terminate
    the copied string with a \0.

2002-09-13  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * NListtree: MUIM_NListtree_Remove had problems when no entry
    was active. Fixed.

2002-07-15  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * nlist_mcc/nlist_mcc2.c: fixed a tiny, but extremly nasty
    bug that caused unnecessary refreshs of nlist objects
    if we had more than one nlist#? object within a group.

2002-07-01  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * The internal pool problem wasn't really fixed. Now it is (I hope)

2002-06-23  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Fixed a bug that the images weren't displayed in single
    columned lists

2002-06-22  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Create also an Internal Pool if user pool was specified
    as some functions require this

2002-06-19  Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@htw-dresden.de>

  * obviously turned this ChangeLog upside down because it
    makes more sense :)
  * removed common/mcc_debug.c as we use dprintf() for MorphOS
    now for debugging purposes.
  * removed the need of creating own ppc headerfiles with
    geninclude.pl, because we can use #pragma pack(2) instead.
  * Updated the MorphOS stuff in all classes to use varargs68k
    stuff instead of this outdated varargs hacks.
  * Did lots of effort to get the whole NList* stuff
    up and running under MorphOS again. Somehow the builds
    where broken.
  * tagged all classes within the CVS with their respect
    release version, so that they can be identified later.

2002-04-02  Richard Poser <whomiga@missingpiece.com>

  * Minor Modifications for the Include files/CPU I have
    * Modified lines 256 and 687 in common/mccheader.h
    * Modified lines 52 and 64 in NList_mcc/library.c
    * Modified line 49 in NList_mcc/smakefile for CPU=68030
    * Modified line 44 in NListviews_mcp/NListviews.c
  * Major Additions/Changes for Special Shorthelp (NList_mcc)
    * private.h:
      * Added lines 489 and 490
      * Changed line 165
    * NList_mcc.c:
      * Added lines 373, 377, 378, 503 and 649
    * NList_mcc1.c
      * Added lines 375-379
    * NList_mcc2.c
      * Added lines 220-224, 319-326, 986-1035 and 1040
    * NList_mcc4.c
      * Added lines 261, 344, 369, 570, 691, 753, 781, 799, 826, 851, 1200 and 1219
      * Changed line 678
  * Special ShortHelp Notes...
    * When an Button Image Object is given a ShortHelp and the Mouse is positioned over the button,
      the ShortHelp for that object will be shown, otherwise the Default ShortHelp for the full
      NList object itself will be shown
  * Not really much of a change - but made CPU=68030 in NList_mcc/smakefile due to my own requirements
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.104
  * Obviously added info to ChangeLog :-)

2002-03-05  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Added a define MUIV_NList_UseImage_All for MUIM_NList_UseImage
    which stands now for -1

2001-12-24  Sebastian Bauer <sebauer@t-online.de>

  * Merged aphaso and sensei changes and commited all files to the
    cvs (only tried the SAS compile)
  * small smakefile changes

2001-07-01  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Added new methods MUIM_NList_Construct and MUIM_NList_Destruct.  Now
    every internal method is calling these methods instead of playing
    with hooks directly.  In NList subclass you can override them to your
    own version.
  * Fixed IdStrings again...  MUI dislikes MCC which haven't $VER:  at
    the beggining of IdString and AboutMUI wasn't showing such MCC (but
    MCC is working correctly!) in the list...
  * Fixed global and local SMakefiles (dependency tree was broken (by me)
    and "sometimes" project wasn't rebuilded...) In global smakefile
    'all' was missing and it cauesed some troubles with objects/
    directories (this's not my fault).
  * Added useful scripts to make and clean objects/ directories.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 20.103

2001-06-27  sensei <sensei@box43.gnet.pl>

  * Changed memory handling routines in NList_func3.c and NList_mcc.c
  * Changed common/mccheader.h to support SAS/C.
  * Changed NList_mcc/NList_mcc.c OM_NEW attributes handling, minor speedup.
  * Fixed every library.c of each MCC, first function of library based
    executable MUST do nothing and return 0.  Executing old MCC causes
    unexpected crashes.
  * Fixed and cleanuped OM_GET method of NList.mcc getting
    MUIA_NList_DragColOnly attribute could cause unexpected results!
  * Fixed library id string. It's not equal to version string!
  * Added missed names of authors in id string.
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.102

2001-06-23  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added MorphOS DoSuperMethod() to NFloattext.c
  * Added common/mcc_debug.h for better debugging ;)
  * Changed common/mcc_debug.c
  * Changed common/mcc_common.h to support GNU/SAS...
  * Changed some internal handling and added tree class support
    in NList ;-)
  * Changed version strings to NList#?.mcc ...
  * Bumped version of NList.mcc to 19.101
  * Fixed wrong MorphOS hooks...

2001-06-20  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Enforcer hit on dispose removed.
  * Now omits column width calculation code if numcols == 1.
    With only one column, NList is now faster than List. Yeahh!
  * Shrink of entries array is now omitted. Same as List does i
    think.

2001-06-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Added experimental value MUIV_NList_Redraw_ColsVisible for
    width calc of only the visible lines.

2001-06-16  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Reworked entry manangement to use pointers insted of full
    structures. This makes NList much faster (factor 3-4) in
    some cases, but slows down a bit when inserting entries at
    the bottom. Not much...

2001-06-14  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Tracked back the floattext wrap bug and fixed it (*_mcc4.c).
    All important lines which were changed between 0.89 and 0.89+
    by Gilles and caused the wrap bug are marked with $$$WRAP for
    future reference.

2001-02-27  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Moved Floattext to own directory and added MorphOS changes

2001-02-18  aphaso <cs@aphaso.de>

  * Re-added makefiles for m68k ;)
  * Added method MUIM_NList_SelectChange
  * Automatic conversion of NList_mcc.h in
    NList_mcc/makefile.ppc
  * Bumped version to 19.98

2000-12-17  Gürer <madcat@linuxfan.com>

  * initial cvs commit
  * mui classes moved to their own directories
  * ppc makefiles added
  * stack check disabled (wasn't compatible with morphos)
  * nlist, nlistview, nlistviews, nfloattext ported to morphos
    (varius hook, vararg, etc patches)
