				  fix all remaining path inheritance problems.
	20060503	jl	- Improvement: Added filetype-specific preview (=thumbnail) generation
				  plugin system. Standard defpicture.pvplugin behaves exactly like
                                  previous build-in thumbnail generation.
				- Improvement: Added jpegpicture.pvplugin thumbnail generator for JPEG
				  images. Thumbnails are generated 2 to 3 times faster than with
                                  default thumbnail generator.
	20060425	jl	- Improvement: Windows are now updated immediately when drag-drop

				  opened, so the thumbnail database can be safely renamed or
				  deleted anytime, and Scalos creates new database next time a
                                  drawer is opened.
	20060322	jl	- Moved image scaling and dithering code to shared library scalosgfx.library.

41.3	20060208	JMC	- Little feature added from File Transfer Class about copy of volumes: 
				  If a "disk" icon is located from the volume to copy and only if this icon type
				  is "WBDISK", the destination drawer icon's image to create will be exactly
				  the same, instead to use the "def_drawer" icon's image.
    	20060203	JMC	- Improvement: Objects without icons aren't removed automatically from

				  priority", "Wait until finished", and wait time (only for tools
                                  located in SYS:WBStartup or any subdirectory).
	20060121	jl      - Improvement: Prefs flag "auto-leaveout" now also has "auto-putaway"
				  functionality, i.e. dragging a left-icon back into its native window
				  automatically issues a "put away" command.

	20050122	JL	- Bugfix: After change of Scalos prefs, text window font (non 
				  TrueType) was no longer recognized, and screen font 
				  was used instead.
	20050110	JL	- After unsuccessful try to quit Scalos (because some 
				  application still has scalos.library open), creation of 
				  new Scalos subprocesses didn't work anymore, e.g. it was 
				  not possible to open the "about" window.
	20050105	JL	- Improved Drag&Drop : Transparency with icon alpha channel 
				  is now also fully supported when multiple icons are dragged.
	20050102	JL	- Finally found and fixed long-standing bug that caused 
				  Scalos to crash on exit (scalos.library expunge function 
				  was called twice, and tried to FreeMem() incorrect pointer).
	20041202	JMC	- Added variable for support hidden files(via FIBF_HIDDEN)
				  in "DeviceWindowClass.c","Class.c","ScanDir.c". Now this

	20040828	JL	- Bugfix: with TrueType fonts, having one softlink in a 
				  text window caused all entries to be displayed underlined.
				- Added new internal commands "iconproperties" and 
				  "windowproperties" (Requires iconproperties.module 
				  and windowproperties.nodule).
				- Bugfix: drag&drop left garbage on screen if custom bob 
				  routines were used and "special" bob (e.g. "forbidden" 
				  or "copying") was visible and was larger than main bob.
	20040716	JL	- Added new qualifier during D&D to force moving of 
				  file system objects (instead of copying).

				  and "abort" buttons of the overwrite request didn't work.
	20040612	JL	- Automatic update of windows caused enforcer hit and 
				  crashes if the modified files containes special 
				  pattern-matching characters in their names (e.g. "()[]#?|").

	20040519	JL	- Menu selection "leave out" (not from popup menu) 
				  caused enforcer hits when issued from "View all" 
				  text window. Fixed.
	20040425	JL	- Added CRC checks over prefs files. Now writing 
				  a prefs file only causes re-reading of prefs and 
				  reinitialization if file contents has actually changed.
	20040424	JL	- Disk Read-Only status display is now updated when 
				  disk is inserted.
	20040419	JL	- Icons without associated object were displayed 
				  incorrectly after window update. Fixed.

				  incorrect window when "Apply to every selected icon" 
				  is enabled.

				  about the original object (Path+Name) for usage by 
				  the iconobject datatypes.
	20040105	JL	- Made icon dd_Flags handling more flexible, so OS3.9 CD 
				  drawers open with correct viewmodes (WB handles 
				  invalid values of "3" like DDFLAGS_SHOWALL).
				- Scalos didn't handle default icons from icon drawer 
				  (e.g. def_drawer.info) correctly. Without separate 
				  DefIcons installed, only the icon.library built-in 
				  icons were used.
	20040104	JL	- Added "skip all" gadget to standard copy/move 
				  "replace" dialog.

 40.29	20031230	JL	- Added full support for alpha channel icon drawing, 
				  including drag&drop ("Custom" bob routines only).
				- Memory for default action in filetype descriptions was 
				  freed while not in use. Fixed.
				- Filetype descriptions are now cached, in order to 
				  improve performance.
				- Starting WB programs left 2 locks dangling. Fixed.
	20031226	JL	- updated "%os" title function to recognize OS 3.5 
				  and OS 3.9.
				- Made localizable string for "BUSY" disks.
				- Popupmenu items now show default action (the action 
				  that is taken upon double-click) in bold text.
	20031222	JL	- Optimization of Drag-and-Drop bobs was broken, leading 
				  to very sluggish drawing of bobs when dragging 
				  multiple icons.
	20031208	JL	- Changed directory for Scalos filetype descriptors
				  from "Scalos:FileTypes/" to "ENV:Scalos/FileTypes/". For 
				  compatibility, Scalos still looks in the old place if the
				  new directory cannot be found.
	20031202	JL	- In Text window, icon update erroneously changed type 
				  from "WBGARBAGE" to "WBDRAWER".

				  in "view all" mode.
	20030727	JL	- To provide a visual hint that popup menu commands only

				  every selected icon, instead of only the icon under 
				  the mouse pointer.
	20030711	JL	- Fixed long delay upon startup when splash window was

				  to crash with "invalid semaphore state" errors.
	20030628	JL	- Fixed several memory leaks associated with 
				  filetype-dependent popup menus and tooltips.
	20030618	JL	- In Window popup menus, "view by text/name" never 
				  displayed a checkmark.
	20030616	JL	- Drawers opened from text view windows did not correctly 
				  inherit the "view all" attribute.
				- Corrected minor typo in About window "100%" was lacking 
				  the percent sign.
	20030615	JL	- Bumped revision to 40.29.
		

 40.28	20030612	JL	- Major improvement in text view window update - now works

				  for WBGARBAGE (Trashcan) icons.
	20030502	JL	- Major improvements to SCA_OpenIconWindow(). Now Scalos 
				  tries hard to find the appropriate icon for the window 
				  to be opened. If an icon is to be found, the window 
				  settings are taken from the icon.
	20030423	JL	- Text windows didn't recognize window resize events 
				  during reading of icons. Fixed.
	20030421	JL	- Rewrote context-sensitive disabling of menu items.

				  icon without default tool is encountered.
				- Added Polish catalog to developer archive, translation
				  by Paweî Szczodry.
	20030418	JL	- Fixed file count routine in filetransclass. The bug 
				  caused incorrect calculation of total byte/item count 
				  and lead to display of more than 100% completion with 
				  nonsense values for "remaining time".
				- Removed display of every single item copied in 
				  filetrans copy/move requester. This optimization greatly 
				  improved copying speed.
	20030327	JL	- Added new method "SCCM_FileTrans_OverwriteRequest"
				  for FileTrans.sca class.
	20030301	JL	- Bugfix: Filetype wasn't set correctly for trashcan.

				  when "backdrop" was turned on and off.
	20030129	JL	- Bugfix: fixed enforcer hits/crashes during window 
				  zoom/resize when "always relayout" was enabled (code 
				  tried to use ptn_bitmap after FreeBitMap()).
	20030126	JL	- Bugfix: added locking mechanism for asynchronous 
				  backfill to avoid crashes when windows are closed while 
				  async backfill process hasn't finished.
	20030118	JL	- Bugfix: fixed enforcer hits when CLI project icon 
				  contained no default tool.

				  an ".info" instead of an icon with the drawer's name.
				- Bugfix: Windows with virtual width or height > 32768 
				  could produce problems from graphical screen 
				  corruption to system crash.
	20030102	JL	- New feature: Icon tooltips can now be user-defined in 
				  the file type description files. Scalos now supports 
				  file type information plugins, e.g. to display size 
				  information about image files.
	20021221	JL	- Bugfix: During file copy operations, icons could be 
				  overwritten without warning.
	20021209	JL	- Bugfix: TextInputHook wasn't used to run program 
				  without icon - instead always execute_command.module 
				  was called.
				- Bugfix: automatic disabling didn't work for some 
				  main menu items (e.g. "sizetofit" didn't get disabled 
				  in backdrop root window).

	20021116	JL	- Fixed broken close-window abort recognition during 
				  GenerateIcons() icon drawing in window.
	20021019	JL	- The user-defined path for default icons was never 
				  used for iconified Scalos window icons. Now it is taken 
				  as fall-back if there are no theme-specific icons.
	20021018	JL	- Changed sizing method for splash window.
	20021014	JL	- Added new methods SCCM_AddToClipboard and

				- Now Scalos first tries to load deficons from 
				  "THEME:DefIcons/". If that fails, the standard 
				  path "ENV:Sys/" is used.
	20021003	JL	- Now uses "titlebarimageclass" for iconify 
				  image if available.
				- changed all makefiles to work with GNU make.

				  "makelink") from ENV:Scalos/ to THEME:PointerIcons/.
	20020915	JL	- Environment variable "scalos/icandy" is recognized
				  if set before Scalos startup. ATM, icandy < 2 turns
				  off splash screen and window status bars.
				  If not set, "Scalos/icandy" gets set with a default
				  value of "2".
	20020914	JL	- Changing "Fullbench" and "Poptitle" now works 
				  on-the-fly and doesn't require rebooting anymore.
				- Locale (language) preferences can now be changed 
				  on-the-fly, no reboot required anymore.

	20020822	JL	- Added optional process priority field for filetype 
				  specific popup menu commands.
	20020817	JL	- Bugfix in FileCommands.c: since ExNext() result
				  ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES was erronously remembered as
				  error, an incorrect error reason could be displayed 
				  when a "real" error occured.
				- Bumped revision to 40.23.
			
			
 40.22	20020812	JL	- Bugfix with "Show All" windows: icon list was read
				  before window was opened, leading to problems with
				  icon layout (invisible icons).
	20020803	JL	- Fixed problems with file type-specific popup menus 
				  and STACK parameter.
	20020801	JL	- Finished conversion of Scalos Pattern Prefs

				  if not all defined pens could be allocated.
	20020529	dm	- Finished converting cleanup code to C.
	20020526	JL	- Fixed bug in the scalos.library expunge code which was 
				  trying to FreeMem() an incorrect library base pointer 
				  when quitting Scalos.
				- When "quit Scalos" is requested, memory is flushed 
				  before checking scalos.library open count, so unused
				  libraries still resident in memory no longer prevent 
				  Scalos from closing.
				- Added optional background image for tooltips 
				  "THEME:TooltipBackground".
				- Added optional background image for window status bar
				  "THEME:Window/StatusBar/Background".

				  which caused Scalos to crash when trying to "cleanup" a 
				  window which had already been cleaned up.
	20020513	JL	- Fixed an icon drag bug: When an icon was clicked with LMB 
				  and the mouse button held for several seconds without 
				  moving the icon, a DisplayBeep() was triggered when the
				  mouse button was released.
	20020504	JL	- Many minor changes to allow Scalos to cpiled with GCC.
				- Replaced handmade CLI startup detaching code by standard
				  cback.o and detach.o mdoules.

				  for SCA_WBStartTags() was incorrect.
	20020412	JL	- When icons were selected purely via keyboard, the
				  "IconActive" variable was not updated and selected 
				  icons could not be opened by pressing "return".
				- When trying to open an disk/drawer icon via wb39/ARexx, 
				  under certain circumstances the Scalos main task could 
				  hang, waiting for a message reply. Fixed.
	20020405	JL	- When prefEnableSplash was turned off after splash window 
				  has opened, the splash window never closed. Fixed.
				- After removing an entry from the hidden device list,
				  that device used to appear multiple times on the Scalos
				  screen. Fixed.
	20020404	JL	- When AppIcon was replaced via AppChange, Scalos tried 
				  to free invalid memory while removing AppIcon. Fixed.
	20020403	JL	- ScalosMain() was called with seglist in d1 instead of 
				  d0, leading to enforcer hits or crash on exit when

				  (IconWindowClass.c)
				- Fixed problem with reading Workbench preferences and then showing
				  Scalos main window in wrong mode/sizes (WindowClass.c)
	20011104	JL	- Icon menu didn't get enabled when icon was selected via

 40.12	20011004	JL	- When converting WindowClass to C, I somehow dropped one 
				  line of code and forgot to clear a window's UserPort 
				  before closing the window. So it could happen that 
				  IntuiMessages in the wt_IconPort already had got freed 
				  by Intuition on closing the corresponding window, 
				  leading to corrupted messages.

				- Now .catalog files are ignored if their version is <40, avoiding
				  trouble with wrong messages.

				- Additional checks on plugin initialization - Now erroneously 
				  added menu plugins should no longer cause Scalos to crash on startup.

				  and SCALOSCTRLA_SetOldDragIconMode.
				- IconWinCheckUpdate() now correctly updates INF_DefaultIcon 
				  flag and INF_SupportsLeaveOut attribute.
	20010811	JL	- Missed a CurrentDir() when renaming objects, leading

				- Due to an incompatibility in Palette.prefs, I renamed it to
				  "Palette13.prefs" . Scalos uses old "Palette.prefs" if

				  copy old "Palette.prefs" to new "Palette13.prefs" or load 
				  Palette prefs editor and use "Save" button to generate 
				  new "Palette13.prefs".
	20010729	JL	- Added check for deleting files of an undefined DirEntryType.

				  "auto remove icons" was turned on, dragged icons left garbage at their
				  original position until finally dropped.
				  Problem (mask BitMap and icon BitMap having different format, 
				  recognizable by different "BytesPerRow" values for equeal width) at 
				  least partially solved by setting friend BitMap to NULL if (Depth <= 8).
	20010716	JL	- Empty lines in ".backdrop" files should be ignored now.
				- CloseWorkBench() from IPrefs Task didn't work. Fixed.

 40.4	20010706	JL	- Enabled "snapshot window" and "snapshot all" for root window again.
	20010705	JL	- Changed locking in DrawDrag() - first call. When "Auto remove icons" was enabled,
				  Icons sometimes didn't get ghosted properly due to DRAGFLAGF_WindowLocked set.
				- Changed initial value for unused oldDir Locks from NULL to $ffffffff, to avoid
				  trouble with pr_CurrentDir = NULL (at the end of functions, CurrentDir() never 
				  got reset to initial value when that value was NULL).
				- AmigaDos menu commands failed to skip trailing '"' if command name is surrounded
				  by '"', e.g. "SYS:xyz" executed with '"' as first argument.
	20010704	JL	- AmigaDos menu commands now inherit the workbench path.
				- Bumped revision to 40.4.

 40.3	20010704	JL	- ReadIcon() didn't respect the "show only icons" setting for text windows, so

				  now also enabled if window is larger than necessary to hold icons.
	20010702	JL	- Screen menu items are now enabled/disabled each time

				  files are not found, both windows fall back to "THEME:ScalosLogo".
	20010617	JL	- Due to an incompatibility in menu.prefs, I renamed it to
				  "menu13.prefs" . Scalos uses old "menu.prefs" if no "menu13.prefs" found.
				  To create new prefs file, either copy old "menu.prefs" to new 
				  "menu13.prefs" or load old "menu.prefs" in menu prefs editor
				  and use "Save" button to generate new "menu13.prefs".
	20010616	JL	- Added new popup menu class for AppIcons.
				- "System Info" button in About window is disabled if sysinfo module cannot
				  be found.
				- Opening new icon windows in iconified state could lead to each icon 
				  appearing twice after uniconifying window - Fixed. Now wt_LateIconList is
				  cleared at the beginning of ReadIconList().

				  instead of objects. Fixed.
				- Bug #13. Drawers inside of text windows no longer open always 
				  in text mode, but use the drawer icon settings instead.
	20010530	JL	- checkmouseicon() and QueryObjectUnderPointer() now take 
				  "Non-masked click area" setting into account.

	2000		DM0006
	2000		DM0005
	20001114	DM0004	- started converting the about requester and related code to C as a test of how painful this is going to be :)
	20001107	DM0003	- added the includes imports.i and exports.i. used for when combining with C code. Also added workaround for symbol export bug in AsmXXX
