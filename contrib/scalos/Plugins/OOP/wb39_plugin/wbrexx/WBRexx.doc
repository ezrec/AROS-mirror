------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTIVATEWINDOW command

Purpose:

This command will attempt to make a window the active one.

Format:

ACTIVATEWINDOW [WINDOW] <ROOT|Drawer name>

Template:

ACTIVATEWINDOW WINDOW

Parameters:

WINDOW

Either ROOT" to activate the Workbench root window (where volume icons and
AppIcons live) or the fully qualified name of a drawer window to activate.
Note that the drawer window must already be open.

If no WINDOW parameter is specified, this command will try to operate on the
currently active Workbench window.

Errors:

10 - If the named window cannot be activated. The error code will be placed
in the WORKBENCH.LASTERROR variable.

Result:

-

Notes:

If you choose to have a window activated that is not the root window you must
make sure that the window name is given as a fully qualified path name. For
example Work:" is a fully qualified name, and so is SYS:Utilities".
Devs/Printers" would not be a fully qualified name. A fully qualified name
always contains the name of an assignment, a volume or a device.

Example:

/* Activate the root window. */ ADDRESS workbench
ACTIVATEWINDOW root

/* Activate the Work:" partition`s window. */
ACTIVATEWINDOW ,Work:`
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGEWINDOW command

Purpose:

This command will attempt to change the size and the position of a window.

Format:

CHANGEWINDOW [WINDOW] <ROOT|ACTIVE|Drawer name> [[LEFTEDGE] <new left edge
position>][[TOPEDGE] <new top edge position>][[WIDTH] <new window
width>][[HEIGHT] <new window height>]

Template:

CHANGEWINDOW WINDOW,LEFTEDGE/N,TOPEDGE/N,WIDTH/N,HEIGHT/N

Parameter:

WINDOW

Either ROOT" to resize/move the Workbench root window (where volume icons and
AppIcons live), ACTIVE" to change the currently active Workbench window or
the fully qualified name of a drawer window to change. Note that the drawer
window must already be open.

If no WINDOW parameter is specified, this command will try to operate on the
currently active Workbench window.

LEFTEDGE

New left edge window position.

TOPEDGE

New top edge window position.

WIDTH

New window width.

HEIGHT

New window height.

Errors:

10 - If the named window cannot be changed; this can also happen if you
specified ACTIVE" as the window name and none of the Workbench windows is
currently active. The error code will be placed in the WORBENCH.LASTERROR
variable.

Result:

-

Notes:

If you choose to have a window changed that is neither the root nor the
active window you must make sure that the window name is given as a fully
qualified path name. For example Work:" is a fully qualified name, and so is
SYS:Utilities". Devs/Printers" would not be a fully qualified name. A fully
qualified name always contains the name of an assignment, a volume or a
device.

Example:

/* Change the root window; move it to position 10,30. * and change its size
to 200100 pixels. */
ADDRESS workbench
CHANGEWINDOW root LEFTEDGE 10 TOPEDGE 30 WIDTH 200 HEIGHT 100

ICON command

Purpose:

This command is for manipulating the icons displayed in a window.

Format:

ICON [WINDOW] <Window name> <Icon name> .. <Icon name> [OPEN] [MAKEVISIBLE]
[SELECT] [UNSELECT] [UP <Pixels>] [DOWN <Pixels>] [LEFT <Pixels>] [RIGHT
<Pixels>] [X <Horizontal position>] [Y <Vertical position>] [ACTIVATE
UP|DOWN|LEFT|RIGHT] [CYCLE PREVIOUS|NEXT] [MOVE IN|OUT]

Template:

ICON WINDOW,NAMES/M,OPEN/S,MAKEVISIBLE/S,SELECT/S,UNSELECT/S,
UP/N,DOWN/N,LEFT/N,RIGHT/N,X/N,Y/N,ACTIVATE/K,CYCLE/K, MOVE/K

Parameters:

WINDOW

Name of the window whose icons should be manipulated. This can be ROOT" to
work on the Workbench root window (where volume icons and AppIcons live),
ACTIVE" to work on the currently active Workbench window or the fully
qualified name of a drawer window. Note that the drawer window must already
be open.

If no WINDOW parameter is specified, this command will try to operate on the
currently active Workbench window.

NAMES

Names of the icons to manipulate.

OPEN

Specifies that the named icons should be opened.

MAKEVISIBLE

Specifies that the named icons should be made visible. This generally works
well for the first icon in a list but does not always work for a whole list.

SELECT

Select the named icons.

UNSELECT

Unselect the named icons.

UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

Move the named icons by the specified number of pixels.

X, Y

Move the named icons to the specified position.

ACTIVATE

This command is for activating the icon closest to the currently selected
icon in the window. Activating" in this context means selecting an icon,
whilst at the same time unselecting all others". Thus, the active" icon is
the only selected icon in the window.

You can indicate which direction the next icon to be activated should be
searched for, relative to the currently active icon. UP" searches upwards,
DOWN" searches downwards, LEFT" searches to the left and RIGHT" searches to
the right.

CYCLE

This command is for cycling through all icons in a window, making each one
the active one in turn (for a description of what active" means in this
context, see the ACTIVATE" description above). You must indicate in which
direction you want to cycle through the icons: you can either specify
PREVIOUS" or NEXT".

MOVE

This command is not for moving icons but for moving through a file system
hierarchy. Thus, moving in" will open a drawer and moving out" will open the
drawer`s parent directory. The IN" parameter will cause the drawer
represented by the active icon to be opened. Please note that an icon must be
selected and it must be a drawer. The OUT" parameter will open the drawer`s
parent directory, and it also requires that in the drawer there is an icon
selected. This may sound strange, but this feature is not meant as a
replacement for the Open Parent" menu item.

Errors:

10 - If the named window cannot be found, none of the Workbench windows are
currently active and the command was set to work on the currently active
Workbench window. The error code will be placed in the WORKBENCH.LASTERROR
variable.

Result:

-

Example:

/* Select the icons of the Workbench" and Work" volumes * displayed in the
root window. */

WINDOW

Name of the window whose menu should be invoked. This can be ROOT" to work on
the Workbench root window (where volume icons and AppIcons live), ACTIVE" to
work on the currently active Workbench window or the fully qualified name of
a drawer window. Note that the drawer window must already be open.

If no WINDOW parameter is specified, this command will try to operate on the
currently active Workbench window.

INVOKE

Name of the menu to invoke. See below for a list of available menu items.

The following set of parameters are for adding and removing menu items.

NAME

Name of the menu item to add or remove. Each menu item must have a name with
which it is associated. The name must be unique and has nothing to do with
the title of the item, as shown in the Tools" menu.

TITLE

This is the text that will be used as the menu item title, as it will appear
in the Tools" menu. This parameter is required if you ADD a new menu item.

SHORTCUT

When adding a new menu item, this will be the menu shortcut associated with
the item. Please note that the shortcut cannot be longer than a single
character and that it will be ignored if there already is an item in any of
the menus which uses this shortcut. This parameter is optional.

ADD

This tells the MENU command to add a new item to the Tools" menu. When adding
a menu item you will also need to specify the NAME, TITLE and CMD parameters.

Starting with V45 you can also add new menu titles beyond

added, all backslashes are removed from their labels; if
you want to retain a single backslash, use two \\ in place
of one; the cleanup code will only remove the first one.

REMOVE

This tells the MENU command to remove a menu item previously added via the
ARexx interface. When removing a menu item you will also need to specify the
NAME parameter.

MOVEWINDOW command

Purpose:

This command will attempt to change the position of a window.

Format:

MOVEWINDOW [WINDOW] <ROOT|ACTIVE|Drawer name> [[LEFTEDGE] <new left edge
position>] [[TOPEDGE] <new top edge position>]

Template:

MOVEWINDOW WINDOW,LEFTEDGE/N,TOPEDGE/N

Parameters:

WINDOW

Either ROOT" to move the Workbench root window (where volume icons and
AppIcons live), ACTIVE" to move the currently active Workbench window or the
fully qualified name of a drawer window to change. Note that the drawer
window must already be open.

If no WINDOW parameter is specified, this command will try to operate on the
currently active Workbench window.

LEFTEDGE

New left edge window position.

TOPEDGE

New top edge window position.

Errors:

10 - If the named window cannot be moved; this can also happen if you
specified ACTIVE" as the window name and none of the Workbench windows is
currently active. The error code will be placed in the WORKBENCH.LASTERROR
variable.

Result:

-

Notes:

If you choose to have a window changed that is neither the root nor the
active window you must make sure that the window name is given as a fully
qualified path name. For example Work:" is a fully qualified name, and so is
SYS:Utilities". Devs/Printers" would not be a fully qualified name. A fully
qualified name always contains the name of an assignment, a volume or a
device.

Example:

/* Move the root window to position 10,30. */
ADDRESS workbench

MOVEWINDOW root LEFTEDGE 10 TOPEDGE 30

/* Move the currently active window. */
MOVEWINDOW active 20 40

Name of the drawer to be created.

Errors:

10 - If the named drawer could not be created.

Result:

-

Notes:

The drawer name given must be an absolute path, such as in RAM:Empty". A
relative path, such as /fred/barney" will not work.

absolute or relative path. For example, wilma" is valid new name, /wilma" or
wilma:" would be invalid names.

Errors:

10 - If the object cannot be renamed.

Result:

-

Notes:

The RENAME command does not work like for example the AmigaDOS Rename"
command. For example, RENAME ,ram:empty` ,newname`" will rename the file
,RAM:empty` to ,RAM:newname`.
