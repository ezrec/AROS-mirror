  @{fg shine}@{b}What's new and what Annotate already features!
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Tool commands now get a console output window if they output anything.

   @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Made the "Quit with changes" requester much better and allows to save.

   @{fg fill}* FIX *@{fg text} Spell corrected guide by Tom Breeden. Thank you!

   @{fg fill}* FIX *@{fg text} Fixed string escaping in the XML prefs such that any characters in paths
           etc can be saved without causing XML parse errors.

   @{fg fill}* FIX *@{fg text} Fixed the Tools edit page which was completely screwed on the MUI versions.

   @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Added Alt as qualifier to temporarely switch selection mode between normal
           and rectangular mode.

   @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Improved rectangular selection such that the width is not dependent on the
           length of the last line the mouse is over.

   @{fg fill}* NEW *@{fg text} Updated the behavior of upper/lower case when there is no selection.
           Now it changes the character under the cursor and advances by char ahead.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.7
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Annotate can now be compiled for MUI instead of ReAction!
      The OS4 version uses ReAction since it looks better and has more
      features under OS4. All other targets are compiled for MUI but
      can be compiled for ReAction/ClassAct as well.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} AROS is now supported.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Added simple project support. This makes it possible to save and
      load a project file which will contain the current configuration of
      opened files and their editors/windows. Makes for a quick way of
      reopening all the files and windows you were working on yesterday,
      or before a crash.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Annotate's editors are now AppWindows which means that you can drop
      icons on them to open files.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Having a requester opening when Ann is started from Workbench is
      now optional.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Realtime update of colors in the editor when they are changed from
      the Config.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Added an expiration date to the "remembered lines".

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Fixed the auto-update function so that it will download the correct
      binary for your OS. (Will of course only work the next time.)

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Pasting an text that started with a linefeed at the end of a line
      didn't work correctly.

   @{fg fill}**@{fg text} Possibly fixed some random garbage that could have been inserted
      when cut'n'pasting vertical blocks with empty lines in the middle.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.6.4
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ported to AmigaOS 3.x and MorphOS!
     It works with the latest ClassAct that can be found on Aminet, but
     it works better with ReAction from AmigaOS 3.5+. Note that on MorphOS
     the latest window.class looks for the wrong version of icon.library
     and fails to open completely. Use an older window.class in this case.
     This will be improved in the future.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a Find next change/Find previous change function to the Search menu.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a weirdness when checking for new updates and none were available
     but extra files were available.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Made errors more clear when shown in the status line.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed copying of  a line to the find or replace field with a vertical
     selection.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.6.3
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Made edited lines appear with a different background color.
     The color is selected by the user.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a new way of finding and replacing words by matching
     only whole unbroken words.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added PortablE as a language with syntax highlighting.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} New icons composed by David Braconnier. Thanks! :)

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} When reopening the same file twice and selected to bring the already
     open editor to front, the current editor was cleared.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The uppercase/lowercase function didn't work on a vertical block selection.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed Ctrl+MMB moving of a vertical selection.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added "mandatory" to the qualifying And/OrTokens to force matching
     this qualification for a particular language at all times.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now tries to not clear a selection when undoing something.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed random insertion of null bytes when loading an MS-DOS file with CR+LF.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Better handling of multiline tokens like for example /* C/C++ comments */.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Better handling of files with very long lines, such as if one accidently
     loads a binary file.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.6.2
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Starts quicker because it doesn't open all gadget classes until they are needed.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a bug in the auto update code.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a crash if expat.library was not found.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added an option to disable the use of system beep/flash.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a few bugs regarding vertical selection/block copy'n'paste and undo/redo.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Changed the scroll wheel acceleration for the scrollbar so that it will
      never jumps more than one page at a time.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.6.1
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Using expat.library instead of linking with expat.lib. Saves 150kB.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Improved archive bit handling.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added HTML as a syntax highlighting.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added LaTeX as a syntax highlighting.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added the attribute "caseinsensitive"/"ignorecase" to make it easy to
          implement syntax for case insensitive languages, such as HTML.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added function to let paste replace a selection.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a kind of UNIX primary selection way of copy'n'paste using the
          middle mouse button. When it is enabled it is possible to select text
          in any editor and then by a click on the MMB paste this text in any
          opened editor without activating its window first!
          Holding Ctrl while clicking the MMB will move the text.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now Ann asks if you try to open the same file twice.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now Ann asks if you try to overwrite a file that exists when using Save as.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added "Wrap selected or all text" to the Tools menu to make it possible
          to wrap a text that is already loaded.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Holding the Ctrl key while closing a window makes it discard all changes
          to the file without asking.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added an iconify gadget which at the moment closes a window and places
          the editor in the hidden editors list in Ed Exchange.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed an error regarding undo when more than one file was selected to be
          opened. This error could result in a number of different behaviours.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Sometimes there was garbage displayed when syntax highlighting was enabled.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} If moving the editor window while replacing interactively answered Yes
          to the requester.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Arexx command GET WIN NAME without a number caused a crash.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} When making your own syntax file Ann could crash if there was an
          error with the OrTokens tag.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the double-click to select word accepts 8-bit characters so that
          non-English words can be completely selected.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a few bugs regarding the Exchange Ed. This needs a total rewrite though.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.6
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} (Major since v2.5) Syntax highlighting with current support for
           C/C++, Amiga-E, AmigaGuide and XML.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} (Major since v2.5) Unlimited Undo/Redo!

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} (Major since v2.5) Ann can remember where in a file you last edited
           and scroll there when the file is opened.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} (Major since v2.5) Double/triple-click to select word, syntactic
           phrase, line or bracket contents.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed many (hopefully all) Undo/Redo bugs, some of which were nasty.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Reimplemented wildcard find. It is now possible to enter a DOS pattern
           string to search for. It will match an entire line.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Multiple cursors when using "Last saved" to revert a file.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It was impossible to select text on the first line.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a subtle problem with match brace causing it to mismatch sometimes.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Improved the smart window placement.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a small ARexx bug regarding cursor placement.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.5.3 (AutoUpdate)
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Finally Ann is on the same level as other modern editors:
      It has got Undo/Redo!
      Beware of possible bugs. May not work will all kinds of editing,
      like vert selections.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added the option "Delete key deletes selection".

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is is now possible to double-click to select a word, line, or the
      contents between ({[brackets and braces]}).

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ann can now remember which line you last visited in a file when
      you save it so the next time you load it, Ann will scroll there
      automatically.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added functionality to allow the Tab key to perform indentation instead
      of inserting tab characters or spaces.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Made it possible to do circular finds. When no more matches are found
      it will start over from the top.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the line in the middle of the window will be seen in the status field
      when scrolling with the scroll bar to make it a lot easier to find a
      particular line.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ann respects file protection bits.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ann can now automatically switch tab-key and indentation mode depending
      on if the file loaded contains tab characters or not.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added "Clear Selection" as a menu option to provide a simple way of
      clearing a selection from the keyboard. Default hotkey is 'RAmiga +'.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a couple of minor bug regarding syntax highlighting, including
      some update of the AnnotateSyntax.xml file.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Many more small changes and enhancements.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.5.2 (AutoUpdate)
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a small error detected by OS4 Final when entering the config
      on OS4 Final.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed another error of the same kind related to the configurable
      part of the Tools menu in Ann.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The Auto Update feature was broken and does not work correctly in
      v2.5.1. It works in v2.5 and v2.5.2 though.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The correct page was not remembered when reentering Config.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.5.1 (AutoUpdate)
  ~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Finally we have Syntax Highlighting! Currently there is support for
      the following languages: C/C++, Amiga-E, Amiga Guide, XML.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Changing of font size was not recognized unless the font was also changed.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Tab-settings and Auto-indent are individual for each editor now.
      Use the Apply button in the Config to set it for all opened editors.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Match Brace has been fixed and enhanced a bit.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Window left and top edge could not be 0.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.5
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Saving config only saved to ENVARC: which made it appear
     as if settings weren't saved until you rebooted.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Auto Update which means that Ann now is able to update
     itself over Internet. It will by default check for updates every
     five days or less.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ann is now a true OS4 Application, meaning that it has full
     Application.library support. Unfortunately there is no
     application handler out there right now.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Search from beginning and Search backwards for Find
     and Replace.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Find Previous to the menu.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The Find requester outputted some debug.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now Esc works in the Find and Replace requesters.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a few arexx command;
     ACTION REPLACE - Replace without opening the replace requester.
     ACTION FIND - Find next and return a bool.
     ACTION FIND_IN_LINE - Find only on current line and return bool.
     INSERT TAB - Insert tab characters.
     BACKSPACE - As hitting backspace.
     SET SEARCH_FROM_BEG - Set this flag for Find and Replace.
     SET SEARCH_BACKWARDS - Set this flag for Find and Replace.
     HELP - Write a list of all commands to a file.

     Included an AmigaE to C translation rexx script that demonstrates the
     potential of scripting with Annotate. It also does a pretty good job
     of doing the dirty work when porting E to C :)

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Doesn't jump to the beginning of the file when
     reverting to last saved.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed loading of files as parameters, both shift-clicked
     from WB and supplied via CLI.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Text selection is visible while selecting.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Holding Ctrl while copying text with MMB cuts text.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added possibility to paste with MMB click a la UNIX.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Cycle Editor in menu on key LAlt+Tab to easily swap
     between editor windows.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Reading and writing hotkeys didn't work correctly.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} A couple of other fixes regarding the editing of hotkeys,
     such as they not working with CapsLock on, and letting repeat
     through as regular keys.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} CursorX doesn't jump to AutoX after Find but stays intuitively
     where is it.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added confirmation requester for all unsaved editors when
     quitting. The requester also now contains the filename.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added the option to keep only one instance of Ann running
     even when starting another copy.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed possible crash in the Ed Exchange editor.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.4
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Closing the Config without a font selected (which is default)
     caused a crash. Fixed. (sorry about that... :-( )
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} All hotkeys (pretty much) are now editable!!
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Scroll-wheel support - context sensitive! Scroll over the text
     and it scrolls "Scroll Unit" lines at a time, scroll over the
     scroll bar and it scrolls pages, scroll to the right of the
     text and it scrolls horizontally.
     Also the horizontal wheel (should) work.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now finally full tab-key support with tab-stops and all!
     Placing the mouse on a line with tabs, moving the cursor with the
     arrow keys, wordwrap, it should all work as expected now.
     Only vertical column selections doesn't work well with tabs now
     (they really can't either as they may cut a tab in half which
     would be illegal).
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Tabs to Spaces and Spaces to Tabs functions.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The default path can now be explicitly selected in the config.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a new marker in the scroll bar that shows the last place
     you were with the cursor if you scroll away and place the cursor
     somewhere else using the mouse. Very practical and makes it dead
     easy to find your way back to where you were.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added option to autosave every X minutes. Autosave only writes
     the backup file if it didn't previously existed, if backups is
     is switched on. This prevents accidental overwrite of an old
     file that you may have opened to create a new file from.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added option to autosave when the edit window gets inactive.
     Very practical if you switch between Ann and for example a
     compiler in a shell, you then don't have to save your changes
     manually, just click outside Ann's window, e.g. in the shell
     and it will automatically save.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a function to switch off the "cursor memory" which may seem
     a bit annoying for those not used to Ann. This means you need to
     switch off "Remember cursor positions" to remove the cursor memory.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a few new short commands:
     Ctrl+Left mouse  immediately starts a selection as a non-sticky
     selection editor would do.
     Middle mouse  immediately selects and copys a text without moving
     the cursor or cancelling another selection. Using Shift copies the
     text into clip unit 1 instead of 0 which is default.
     These, and the other mouse-"keys" are not editable.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is now possible to open many files at the same time from the
     file-requester.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added switch top make the cursor follow when scrolling using the
     numpad scroll-keys.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added key to get cursor into view. It defaults to numpad-0.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added switch to make new windows open relative to parent window
     instead of the default position.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Forgot to check the "Smart window placing" switch. It was always
     used.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now compiled with NewLib which made the exe 50kB smaller than
     with CLib2. Unfortunately all new features added another 100kB.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Ann shouldn't die the Linux death when given Ctrl-C anymore.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} A lot of other minor fixes, like the save requester gave no
     busy-pointer to the editor, replacing repetitive characters
     didn't work, save close now quits if the last editor was closed,
     Shrink/Enlarge Ann works now.


  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.3
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} ReAction is now used for just about everything except for the editor
     itself! The Config, most notable, has been completely remade and now
     has the same structure as SYS:Prefs/GUI. The remake of the config
     also made it easier to add a lot more settings.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Tab characters are now supported! It's not 100% perfect but way
     better than nothing.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} UTF-8 support! It is possible to load files with UTF-8 to Latin1
     conversion, and to paste text with UTF-8 to Latin1 conversion.
     I don't know how to convert anything else than Latin1 now though.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Word wrap can now be performed when loading a text file.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added busy-pointer to the editor windows when a requester is open.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a bunch of sneaky hotkeys that could be very useful:
     * Ctrl+Del  deletes everything to the right of the cursor.
     * Ctrl+BackSpace  deletes everything to the left of the cursor.
     * Shift+Del  deletes all white spaces to the right of the cursor.
     * Shift+BackSpace  deletes all white spaces to the left of the cursor.
     * Ctrl+Enter  causes the very unique Anti-Enter! This is a
       linefeed upwards in the text! (See the guide for more info.)
     * Shift+Enter  temporarily inverts the Auto Indent flag.
     * Alt+BackSpace  deletes a "tabs size" number of characters to the left.
     * See the guide for a complete list of old and new key combinations.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a lot of hotkeys that didn't work.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is now possible to change font.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added proper Use and Last Saved to the Config.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is now possible to side-shift text in steps of tab size, not
     just one space at a time.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is also possible to side-shift one line of text without
     selecting it first.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Changed backup behaviour to rename the old file as #?.bak instead
     of just writing two copies when saving.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The status line now has its own background colour and it is fixed
     to the bottom of the window instead of the bottom of the text.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Enter now responds to key-repeat.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Arrow-keys now have the option to run through lines instead of
     stopping at the beginning or end of the line it is on.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now it is possible to abort a replace operation or a repeating
     macro event by hitting Escape or clicking the window close button.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added some info, like "Replace - Done" and "Replace - Text not found"
     when replacing.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is now possible to have newly paste text selected.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Various small cosmetic enhancements.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed the scroll bar which got inverted when the window was very
     small and there were only few lines of text.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed pasting of multiple clip chunks, such as from YAM which often
     caused garbage to be pasted into Ann. Now with UTF-8 paste support
     it is very nice to be able to paste UTF-8 e-mails into Ann to be
     able to read them comfortably :-)

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a couple of bugs regarding selection of text. If in column
     select mode and side-shifting until the block shrunk to zero size
     it would crash. There were other old crashy selection bugs as well
     that are fixed.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a couple of cosmetic selection bugs.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The text and background color wasn't used properly.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed "Repeat next event" which didn't work at all as it got eaten
     by mouse move events.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.2
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} When saving prefs the XML prefs file did not become well-formed and
     could therefore not be read. How stupid of me to not test that in
     the final release (it obviously worked in my betas).

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Colors (pens) for most things can now be edited.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} New look scroll bar! No more black boring rectangle (unless you
     want to of course).

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Diminished the "WINDOW TO SMALL TO SCROLL!!!" message even further.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now Ann preserves protection bits of files which makes it a lot
     more convenient to edit scripts with the 's' bit set for example.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now you can choose to work with a filled cursor contrary to the
     unfilled box.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added Apply and Cancel to the preferences.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the Find and Number requesters only require Enter in the
     string/integer gadget to close.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} When the mouse is pressed down to scroll or mark text and another
     program pops up a requester, the mouse won't stick to Ann any more.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the CPU-loop is all gone which means no flickering when the
     mouse is pressed down somewhere in the editor or scroller.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed a few small cosmetic issues.

  @{fg shine}@{b}v2.1
  ~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now it's possible to have text unselected after it has been copied.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Annotate handles Carriage Return (from PC texts) while reading and
     a setting specifies if you want to save with or without Carriage
     Return unrelative to the input file.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Go to the beginning of the line now has one additional meaning:
     Shift+Left or Home can now optionally place the cursor at the first
     character in a line instead of at the very beginning.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Annotate can now place successive windows in a smart way, cascading
     I think, so they are easier to manage.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} If you never use Arexx with Annotate you can switch it off. This
     will effectively remove the "Could not create arexx port" message
     that always popped up if multiple instances of Annotate was started.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The autoscroll when clicking in any outer region of the text in the
     window can now be slightly delayed to make it possible to put the
     cursor on a character in this area without accidently scrolling away.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added the current filename to the screen title bar to make it easier
     to see what file is being edited if the name doesn't fit in the
     status line.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now Annotate won't use 100% CPU when holding down the mouse button.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Several code speed-ups when loading and saving files.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Enabled pasting of 8-bit ASCII, and tab.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} It is now possible to have the Tab key insert real tabs into the text.
     (It will only be displayed as one unprintable (blank) character though,
     and will not induce an indentation as may be expected. A rewrite of
     the draw routines will have to be made for that to work.)

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} PC-keys PgUp, PgDown, Home, End works as intended now.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Annotate now remembers paths and filenames in requesters all the time
     and everywhere. Also saves path so one can have a default path.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Made it possible to resize the window with contents.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a status message "Not found" after searching when nothing was found.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} The "WINDOW TO SMALL TO SCROLL!!!" message can now be diminished
     by letting Annotate scale the Scroll Unit to the window size.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now the editor window can be placed where one wants it and then
     press "Get Window Dimensions" instead of guessing and entering the
     values manually.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Now using XML for prefs saving and loading, removed s:AnnConfig saving.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Removed the little window that popped up in the top-left corner at startup.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Changed some menu hotkeys so they will work on (Swedish) PC-keyboards.
     In the future all hotkeys will be configurable.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed the ever varying text mark color when used on hi/true-colour
     screens.

   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Set the WFLG_NewLookMenus flag to make the menus look up-to-date.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Added a checkmark to the Line/Vert select menu item to make it
     easier to see what mode one is in.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed paste from empty clipboard which switched off Auto indent.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Fixed paste from empty clipboard which marked the file as modified.
   
   @{fg fill}*@{fg text} Status wasn't displayed as modified when deleting characters, now it is.

@node "install" "Installing Annotate"

  @{b}INSTALLATION@{ub}
       Annotate needs no special installation. Just copy the entire directory,
  or just the executable of your choice, to any place on your hard disk.

       Syntax highlighting: A note about the file "AnnotateSyntax.xml" though.
  This file is meant to be put in ENVARC: to be accessible to Ann no matter
  from where it is executed. However, you can also let it stay in the program
  directory too, if you like. If it exists in both locations, the version in
  the program directory will be read first so that you can have a special
  version of the syntax file if you start Ann from a special place, but let
  default be to read from ENVARC:.

@endnode
@node "intro" "Notes about Annotate"

  @{b}FUNDAMENTALS@{ub}
       Some of the basic concepts of this text editor are far different than 
  regular text editors.  

       Firstly, Annotate (Ann for short) has a cursor separate from the selection
  unless the NotePad markmode is used. For instance, one could move the cursor
  wherever he or she pleases without losing the selection.
  A bit like "sticky selection" in other editors but not as annoying as I've
  felt it to be in other editor. In fact, if one was to edit the text inside
  the selection, the highlight would resize accordingly. So how to unselect
  text then? - Simple: Just click on the cursor, or use the menu option Clear
  Selection, preferably through its hotkey.

       As this text editor was created with programmers in mind, it has many
  features useful to programmers such as syntax highlighting and macros.

       The cursor is drawn using complement, which means that it inverts the
  color under it. This means that if you have a color equal or close to medium
  grey (RGB=128,128,128) you will not see the cursor. In this case it is a
  good idea to go into the Config from the Tools menu and change the background
  color slightly to something darker or brighter.

       The scroll bar also has features many other editors lack, such as that
  it shows where the cursor is, and where it last was, in the text which makes
  it easy to find your way back. It can also show where there are changes in
  the text and more. The @{"Usage" link usage} page describes it in more detail.

@endnode
@node "usage" "Features of Annotate"

  @{fg shine}@{b}Overview of how Annotate works
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

       Annotate is a multi-window editor where each file is opened in its own
  window. Editors (that is, opened files) can also be hidden from view using the
  @{"Ed Exchange" link window_menu} so that you can effectively work on different
  files in only one or just a few windows.

       An editor window is very streamlined to give room to as many lines of
  text as possible while still presenting useful status information using its
  status bar and also the scrollbar.


  @{b}Status Bar@{ub}
       When editing text in Annotate, one would notice the current status line 
  at the bottom.
  
  A typical display would look like this:
  
  @{bg shine} "DH1:Ann/AnnotateDoc"  Line:   25/85  Col: 30  Modified Sel Srl LS Char: 32@{bg back}

  On the very left is the current document you are editing. It may be shortend
  to show only @{bg shine}"../AnnotateDoc"  @{bg back} if there is not enough room for the whole path.

  Next is the current cursor column and line display, then "Modified".  If
  "Modified" is present the text has been edited since the last save, and Ann
  will prompt for saving changes if you try to quit or load a new document.

  "Sel" is used to indicate if there is any text currently selected. This is
  useful as many menu items act on a selection, and not necessarily the cursor.

  "LS" which may also say "VS" tells whether the current editor is in line
  selection mode or vertical (i.e. block) selection mode.

  "Srl" means that the numeric keypad is in scroll mode. It could also read
  "Num" at which time you can input numbers with the keypad.

  The last part shows the ASCII-value of the character under the cursor.

  Also, any error messages are conveyed on this bottom line, temporarily
  replacing the stats and displayed in another color.


  @{b}Scroll Bar@{ub}
       But not just any scroll bar. A scroll bar should show you where you 
  are in relation to the top and bottom of text. Ann's scroll bar also 
  shows you where your cursor, selection, last cursor position, and scroll
  stores are.  Try it, you'll find it very useful.
  
       A very important part of Annotate is its ScrollStores, these beasties 
  are used to save your current position in the document.  It is useful when 
  programming, when trying to find the little piece of code within 100s of lines 
  or more.  All one has to do, is set a ScrollStore there, and then call that 
  same ScrollStore when one wants to return.  There are 6 different ScrollStore 
  locations, so up to six positions may be saved.  - Note: ScrollStore merely
  identifies vertical and horizontal scroll, not the actual text your 
  looking at. On the scroll bar they appear as lines with a number under 
  them to indicate which scrollstore the line represents.


  @{b}Projects@{ub}
       Since v3.0 Ann supports a simple kind of project model. This means that
  it is possible to save the state of all opened files, editors and their windows
  in a project file. See the @{"Project menu" link project_menu}. This file can later be opened again
  and Annotate will then try to load all the files and open and position all
  windows that were part of the project so everything looks just like when you
  saved it.

       Saving or opening a project will make all associated editors part of
  the project. To disconnect the editors from the project, or close all editors
  that are part of a project you can select @{"Close Project" link project_menu} from the menu.
  When a project exists, saving the project will not automatically add new files
  to the project. You need to close the project and then save it again to add
  new files to the project.


  @{b}Quick keys not in the menu, but editable in the config@{ub}

       @{u}Ctrl + Left/Right Arrow keys@{uu}
  Will move you to the beginning or end of the next word on the current line.

       @{u}Shift + Left/Right Arrow keys@{uu}
  Will move the cursor to the beginning of line and end of line. Beginning of
  line can be interpreted in two ways: absolute beginning or first non-white
  space character. You can change this in the Config window.

       @{u}Shift + Up/Down Arrow keys@{uu}
  Will move the cursor to the top of screen and bottom of the screen.
  When already at the top or bottom of screen it will scroll the text
  @{"scroll unit" link config} number of lines at a time.

       @{u}Home/End/PageUp/PageDown@{uu} (The PC keyboard ones)
  Works exactly as Shift + Arrow keys.  Note: These keys on the numpad,
  including numpad arrow keys work a bit different.

       @{u}Ctrl + Del@{uu}
  Deletes everything to the right of the cursor.

       @{u}Ctrl + BackSpace@{uu}
  Deletes everything to the left of the cursor.

       @{u}Shift + Del@{uu}
  Deletes all white spaces to the right of the cursor.

       @{u}Shift + BackSpace@{uu}
  Deletes all white spaces to the left of the cursor.

       @{u}Right Alt + BackSpace@{uu}
  Deletes a "tabs size" number of character to the left of the cursor.

       @{u}Shift + Enter@{uu}
  Temporarily inverts the Auto indent flag. If you have Auto indent enabled in
  the config but would like to make an unindented linefeed you can press
  Shift + Enter. In the same manner, if you have Auto indent off but
  temporarily want to use it you press Shift + Enter. If you don't know
  what Auto indent is then this is a very good way of testing it :)

       @{u}Ctrl + Enter@{uu}
  Causes the unique Anti-Enter! This is a linefeed upwards in the text!
  Think about this situation: You have the following line:

@{fg shine}    if(whatever = 123) /* 123 is a magic number */@{fg text}

  but you would like to have the comment on the line above the
  if()-statement. Normally you would need to cut'n'paste, but with
  Anti-Enter you just place the cursor at the end of the if()-statement
  and press Ctrl + Enter and you automagically get this:
@{fg shine}
    /* 123 is a magic number */
    if(whatever = 123)
@{fg text}

       @{u}Ctrl + LMB@{uu}
  Select text without first moving the cursor to the place to select text.
  This means that if you hold Ctrl, selecting text works as in most other
  text editors.

       @{u}Alt + LMB@{uu}
  Inverts the selection mode such that you can make a @{"Rectangular Selection" link setting_menu}
  without first switching to this mode from the menu. And vice versa if you
  have selected rectangular mode you can hold an Alt key to temporarely make
  a normal selection with the mouse.

       @{u}MMB@{uu}
  The middle mouse button can be configured in a variety of ways, explained
  below. See the Clipboard page in the Annotate Config for all the settings.

  - It can be configured to let you select text directly, like if holding Ctrl.
  This is called Quick-select using MMB.
  - It can be configured to let you select text and also copy it immediately
  when you release the middle mouse button. This is called Quick-copy using
  MMB. In this case the editor can also be configured to scroll back to the
  last cursor position and also keep any previous selection. Perfect when
  you just need to scroll away and copy something without loosing a selection
  or cursor placement in the file.
  - When configured to copy text you can hold Shift to copy into clipboard
  unit 1 instead of 0.
  - When configured to copy text you can hold Ctrl to cut text instead of
  copying. Also works together with Shift to cut text into clipboard unit 1.
  - It can be configured to paste text when clicking, sort of like in UNIX.
  There are actually two way of doing this: One is to use the function of
  pasting when clicking the MMB. This way works best together with Quick-copy.
  The second is to enable the UNIX Primary Selection emulation. This way
  works best together with Quick-select.

  @{b}A word about making selections@{ub}
       Normally Ann has an unfilled box for a cursor but if you click down
  on the cursor it will become filled in. If you drag the cursor to a new 
  position and let go Ann will make a selection from where you started to 
  where you ended.

  @{b}About the close gadget@{ub}
       It should be noted that hitting the close gadget in Ann's last window
  (which would cause most programs to quit) Ann will close the editor in 
  the window but will not close the window if there is an editor in the 
  external editor list. Instead it will put the first external editor into 
  the window. However if there is not an external editor Ann will quit 
  just like most programs. External editors are managed using the Ed Exchange.
  
  If you hold Ctrl when closing a window a file that has been modified will
  be discarded without a warning.

@endnode
@node "startup" "Startup"

  @{b}Starting from Workbench:@{ub}

     To start Ann from Workbench simply double click on the Ann icon in 
     which case Ann will appear with the ASL file requester ready for you 
     to use, or by double clicking on a project icon with Ann as the default 
     tool in which case Ann will appear and immediately load the file.

     It is also possible to start Ann by Shift-clicking with other files
     in which case Ann will load these immediately. See also "Open documents/
     new editor in the same instance" under Options in the @{"Config" link config}.


  @{b}Starting from the Shell:@{ub}

     If you start Ann from the shell you have the option of suppling a 
     file list to be loaded at startup. See also "Open documents/new editor
     in the same instance" under Options in the @{"Config" link config}.

     On startup Annotate will search for its config files. Ann looks for 
     three files:

          1) ENV:Annotate.xml
          2) Default.AnnMacs
          3) ENV:Annotate.autoupdate
          4) ENVARC:AnnotateLastLine.xml

     1) Annotate.xml contains the default settings for window placement, 
     rendering options, etc. It is created by use the "Save" and "Use"
     gadgets in the Config window.

     2) Default.AnnMacs is a Macro file created by using the "Save Macros" 
     command from the menu. Ann looks for Default.AnnMacs in the Current 
     directory and if it is not found there then Ann searches S:.

     3) Annotate.autoupdate is used to keep track of when was the last time
     Ann checked for updates over the net. Usage of this is configurable.

     4) AnnotateLastLine.xml contains the last line each file was last
     visited if this feature is enabled in the config.

     If any of these files are not present Ann will resort to its built-in
     default settings for that file.

     When Ann has loaded all config files it will open on the configured screen.
     Ann will also use the default fonts of the screen unless otherwise
     configured. Also Ann must run on a screen at least 640x200. If the
     default public screen is smaller this 640x200 Ann will fail to open
     and supply an error message that the screen is to small.

@endnode
@node "config" "The Configuration Window"

  @{fg shine}@{b}The Configuration Window
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  This window contains settings regarding the behavior and appearance
  of Annotate. See below for an explanation of all settings.

  The new config window consists of six topics listed to the left in
  the config window.

  @{u}Editor@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Operation@{fg text}

      @{b}Smart start of line@{ub}
        Normally when Shift+LeftArrow or Home is pressed Ann will move the
        cursor to the actual beginning of the line. With this switch Ann
        will instead move the cursor to the first non-white character of
        a line. However, if the cursor is already on the first non-white
        character or to the left of it, but not at the actual beginning,
        it will instead move the cursor to the actual beginning of the line.

        This behavior can be seen in many text editors.

      @{b}Auto indent@{ub}
        Normally when pressing Enter, a new line will be made and the
        cursor will be put at the beginning of that line. With this switch
        Ann will instead insert as many spaces at the beginning of the
        new line as there are spaces in the previous line and thus put
        the cursor right below the first non-white character of the
        previous line.
    
        This behavior can be seen in many text editors.

        @{u}NOTE:@{uu} This setting is editor local which means that if you change
              this, only the editor from which you opened the config will
              see the effect of the change unless you press @{b}Apply@{ub} which
              will cause the change to be applied to all open editors.

      @{b}Arrow-keys move through lines@{ub}
        Normally the cursor stays on one line when you use the left and
        right arrow keys, i.e. if you are at the end of a line the cursor
        won't go any further, but with this enabled the cursor will in
        this case go to the beginning of the next line, like most editors
        do.

      @{b}Key-repeat Del/BackSp through lines@{ub}
        When you hold in the Delete or Backspace key to delete character
        and you have deleted a hole line it will automatically start
        chewing on the next line. This can be dangerous as you might
        remove too many characters.
        If you disable this setting the Delete and Backspace keys will
        stop deleting when reaching the end or beginning of the current
        line when held down. You then have to let go and press again to
        continue with the next line.

      @{b}Remember cursor positions@{ub}
        Deselect this if you don't want the cursor to jump unexpectedly
        after pasting and typing text.

    @{fg shine}Tabulators@{fg text}

      @{b}Tab-key inserts real tab@{ub}
        If you select this then the tab key will insert real tabs (ASCII 9)
        into your text instead of a series of spaces. Note that tabs are
        currently always drawn the size of @{b}Tab size:@{ub} ignoring
        any implied tabstops. Tabs are therefor currently only useful at
        the beginning of lines, not to make nice columns in the middle of
        text. That will come in a later version of Ann.

        This however makes it possible to edit makefiles which require tabs.

        The Load option "Set tab mode and indent mode depending on if files
        contain tabs" can override this setting.

        @{u}NOTE:@{uu} This setting is editor local which means that if you
              change this, only the editor from which you opened the config will
              see the effect of the change unless you press @{b}Apply@{ub} which will
              cause the change to be applied to all open editors.

      @{b}Tab-key indents@{ub}
        Normally the tab key inserts a tab character or a series of spaces.
        With this switch it is however possible to make it act also as an
        indent key. When this switch is activated the tab key acts as follows
        (deciding in this order):
        1. If the cursor is at the left edge the line will be indented to
           the same depth as the previous line, unless the previous line is
           not indented at all. In that case normal tab behaviour is applied.
        2. If the cursor is on any of the leading white spaces of a line
           and more to the left than the indentation of the previous line
           the line will be indented as the previous line.
        3. If the cursor is on any of the leading white spaces of a line
           but further to the right than the indentation of the previous
           line, the current line will be indented to start where the cursor
           is at.
        4. If the cursor is on any other character, normal tab behaviour is
           applied, i.e. a tab character, or a set of space characters will
           be inserted.

      @{b}Auto indent with tabs@{ub}
        Select this if you like Ann to fill the auto indented space with
        tabs instead of spaces.

        The Load option "Set tab mode and indent mode depending on if files
        contain tabs" can override this setting.

        @{u}NOTE:@{uu} This setting is editor local which means that if you
              change this, only the editor from which you opened the config will
              see the effect of the change unless you press @{b}Apply@{ub} which will
              cause the change to be applied to all open editors.

      @{b}Side-shift with tabs@{ub}
        When you use the menu functions to @{"shift" link edit_menu} text sideways it may be
        desirable to shift with the size of tabs instead of single spaces.
        In that case you can enable this setting.

        @{u}How it works:@{uu}
          When in normal selection mode:
            When shifting to the right:
              A tab will be inserted at the beginning of every selected line.

            When shifting to the left:
              If a tab char is found at the beginning of a line it will be
              deleted. If not, the line will be searched until the first
              non-with space is found and then the last white spaces will
              be deleted in such a way that the text has shifted exactly tab
              size number of characters.

          When in vertical selection:
            When shifting to the right:
              A tab will be inserted at the position the vertical block
              starts at if the line does not start to the left of the
              selection, then the line will be unaffected.

            When shifting to the left:
              If a tab char is found at the position the vertical block starts
              at, it will be deleted. If not, the line will be searched until
              the first non-with space is found and then the last white spaces
              will be deleted in such a way that the text has shifted exactly
              tab size number or characters. Nothing will be done if the line
              ends before the block selection starts.

      @{b}Tab size:@{ub}
        Specifies how many spaces should be inserted when you press the
        Tab key, provided that you don't have @{b}Tab Inserts Real Tab@{ub} selected
        because then one tab character will be inserted but displayed as
        if it were this number of spaces. This is also the number of spaces
        that will be inserted for every tab character found when reading a
        text file containing spaces when you confirmed to convert tabs to
        spaces.

        @{u}NOTE:@{uu} This setting is editor local which means that if you
              change this, only the editor from which you opened the config will
              see the effect of the change unless you press @{b}Apply@{ub} which will
              cause the change to be applied to all open editors.

    @{fg shine}Scrolling@{fg text}

      @{b}Numpad scroll-keys on@{ub}
        This setting works pretty much the same way a NumLock key works on
        a PC(-keyboard). Enabling this setting will make the numpad keys
        scroll the text in different directories but without the cursor
        following.

      @{b}Cursor follows scroll-keys@{ub}
        Select this if you like the cursor to follow when you scroll using
        the non-cursor scroll-keys.

      @{b}Ignore wheel acceleration@{ub}
        In OS4 Final there is a setting to accelerate the mouse wheel
        movements. This can make Ann scroll very much every time which may
        not be desired. With this switch it is possible to ignore the
        acceleration set in the OS and only let Ann decide how much to
        scroll instead.

      @{b}Disable horizontal scrolling@{ub}
        Normally the scroll wheel will scroll the text side-ways if the
        scroll wheel is used outside to the left or right of the editor
        window unless you have a second wheel dedicated for horizontal
        scrolling that you have used. This can be annoying if you, like
        most people, only have one vertical scroll wheel.

      @{b}Use dynamic scroll unit@{ub}
        Ann will automatically scroll if you click in an outer region
        of the text, or try to move the cursor to an outer region. Now
        if the editor window is made so small that these regions overlap
        from left to right or top to bottom it will be impossible to scroll
        the text in the window.
    
        If this switch is set then Ann will try to automatically scale
        the scroll unit (i.e. the outer region size) to always fit in the
        window.

      @{b}Static scroll unit:@{ub}
        Specifies how many lines vertically, and characters horizontally,
        at the edges of the text area that will trigger scrolling of the
        text. The further out in these outer regions defined by the scroll
        unit you click with the mouse, the faster the text will scroll.

      @{b}Scroll delay (ms):@{ub}
        When clicking in one of the outer regions of the text, the text
        will start to scroll. This is a very convenient feature, but can
        be annoying when you only want to place the cursor on a line
        or character in this scroll area. Therefor there is a small delay
        before the scrolling begins to make it possible to place the cursor
        with a short mouse click without accidently scrolling away. This
        field specifies how many milliseconds to wait before scrolling
        begins. See also @{b}Static scroll unit@{ub}.

    @{fg shine}Word Wrap@{fg text}

      @{b}Word wrap while typing@{ub}
        This will perform simple word-wrapping as you type. It does not
        work like in fancy wordprocessors where a complete section can be
        edited and wrapped on-the-fly. The internals of Ann will not allow
        that without a major rewrite.

      @{b}Word wrap column:@{ub}
        Sets the column, i.e. line length, at which the word wrap should
        occur.


  @{u}Clipboard@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Copy'n'Paste@{fg text}

      @{b}Keyboard select qualifiers@{ub}
        What key should be used as qualifier for keyboard selection.
        You hold down the key of your choice, for example the Alt key,
        and use arrow keys for move the cursor and mark text.

      @{b}Selection mode@{ub}
        Choose how Ann should treat selections:
        - @{u}Annotate@{uu} mode is a sticky mode and the normal way Ann always have
          handled selections. In this mode you must click @{i}on @{ui}the cursor to
          start or cancel a selection using the mouse. Typing, moving the
          cursor or deleting text or clicking somewhere else than on the
          cursor will not alter the selection.
          I would say this is the most efficient mode when you get used to it
          and using a hotkey for menu->Edit->Selection->None to cancel selection
          and the @{b}Quick-select using MMB click'n'drag@{ub} setting.

        - @{u}Notepad@{uu} mode is a volatile selection mode that is used by
          most editors, such as NotePad. Anything will cancel a selection such
          as clicking anywhere with the mouse, typing text or moving the cursor.
          This is the least efficient mode and I only recommended for people who
          have worked too much with editors of this type and cannot change their
          habits.

        - @{u}Quick-select@{uu} is a sticky mode but not as sticky as @{u}Annotate@{uu}. It lets
          you start or cancel a selection by clicking anywhere on the text, like
          @{u}Notepad@{uu} mode, but moving the cursor or typing text will not
          cancel the selection.
          Useful compromise if you find the @{u}Annotate@{uu} mode annoying.

      @{b}Let a selection be replaced when pasting@{ub}
        This setting make Ann replace a selection when you paste. Many
        editors work this way.

      @{b}Delete key deletes selection@{ub}
        If this is selected the Delete key will delete a selection of
        text as in many other editors, instead of only delete characters
        regardless of any selection.

      @{b}Unselect marked area after copy@{ub}
        Ann features a kind of sticky selection. This means that text
        that is marked will stay marked until you explicitly unmark it by
        clicking within the cursor (or effectively double-click anywhere
        @{u}on@{uu} the text). With this switch selected text will unmark itself
        when it is copied.
        This setting does not affect the Emulate UNIX copy'n'paste method.

      @{b}Select pasted text@{ub}
        With this enabled blocks you paste will be selected. This can be
        useful especially with vertical selection to be able to see exactly
        how it got pasted which is not always so easy with vertical pastes.

      @{b}Paste with UTF-8 to Latin1 conversion@{ub}
        Ann has a UTF-8 filter that you can paste text through. Useful
        when you have some text in UTF-8 in a mail or on a homepage that
        you would like to be able to read more easily.
        Just start Ann, enable this setting and paste the text into Ann.


      @{b}Double-click to select a word of block@{ub}
        When this is selected a double-click @{u}on the cursor@{uu} will select a word
        or block. This is somewhat intelligent:
        If you double-click (DC) on a letter or digit Ann will select all
        adjacent letters and digits.
        If you DC on an underscore ('_'), both letters, digits and underscores
        will be selected.
        If you DC on any of these: "+*/-=<>&|%?:" an entire expression can
        be selected.
        There are more combinations, like double-clicking an '@' sign to select
        an e-mail address.

        To select a block you can DC on any of ({[]}) and everything between
        it and its counterpart will be selected. This is an easy way of matching
        braces.

      @{b}Triple-click to select a line@{ub}
        When this is selected you can triple-click @{u}on the cursor@{uu} to select
        a complete line.


      @{b}Quick-select using middle mouse-button click'n'drag@{ub}
        This lets you select test anywhere directly using the MMB.
        Quick is useful together with the Emulate UNIX way of copy'n'paste.

      @{b}Quick-copy using middle mouse-button click'n'drag@{ub}
        Using the middle mouse-button (MMB) to copy or cut text becomes possible
        when this is selected. Adding Shift makes the copy go into clipboard
        unit 1 instead of the normal unit 0. Adding Ctrl makes it cut text
        instead of copying.
        Not recommended together with the Emulate UNIX way of copy'n'paste.

      @{b}Paste with the middle mouse-button@{ub}
        Lets you paste text by clicking the MMB. The text will be pasted at
        the location you click, which might not be where the cursor currently
        is. Add Shift to make it paste from clipboard unit 1 instead of 0.
        When used together with MMB Quick-copy it pastes when the button is
        released without having moved. (If moved a quick-copy will then happen
        instead.)

      @{b}Remember last cursor position after MMB quick-copy or paste@{ub}
        To make the two above options powerful this option is also enabled.
        It will make the cursor jump back to its previous location in the text.
        It also preserves any previous selection even after a quick-copy.

      @{b}Jump to last cursor position after MMB quick-copy@{ub}
        Much like the above option but also scrolls the editor back to the
        last position instead of only setting the cursor back.

      @{b}Emulate UNIX "Primary Selection" way of copy'n'paste@{ub}
        If you like the UNIX way of copy'n'pasting you may want to enable this option.
        This is similar to the above Quick-copy and Paste with MMB options.
        However, if you have used Linux or UNIX you know that it can work a
        bit different. Let me explain:
        To copy text, you first just select text anywhere, in any editor.
        Then you click the middle mouse button where you want the text copied
        to, which may be in another, possibly inactive, window.
        To move text, i.e. to cut'n'paste you do the same. That is, you select
        the text you want to cut and paste, i.e. move. Then you hold the Ctrl
        key while clicking with the middle mouse button and the selected text
        will move there.

        Note: Beware that in AmigaOS (and Annotate) you can have text selected
        in many programs and windows at the same time. This is not possible in
        UNIX. This makes it uncertain which selected source will be used when you
        use this function in Ann if you have many windows open an text selected
        in more than one window.
        One this is for sure though; it will always look in the active window
        first before it starts scanning the other editor windows for selections.


  @{u}Hotkeys@{uu}

    In this page you can edit most hotkeys in the program. The treeview
    first contains a list of the menu actions and then a list of all invisible
    keyboard command actions and their current hotkeys.

    @{fg shine}Keyboard shortcuts@{fg text}

      @{b}Add@{ub}
        Here you can add a new action. If you would like to add another
        hotkey for a menu action you selected that menu action and click
        Duplicate instead. This list contains only the hidden actions.

      @{b}Duplicate@{ub}
        Click this if you would like to add another hotkey for the selected
        action.

      @{b}Edit@{ub}
        Click here to edit an action. A window will open in which you press
        your hotkey. Close the input window when finished.

        You can also double-click in the list to edit a hotkey for an
        actions. You can also edit menu actions that have a blank hotkey.
        This is how you add a hotkey for a menu action that doesn't already
        have a hotkey defined.

      @{b}Remove@{ub}
        Click to remove the selected hotkey. Removed menu action hotkeys
        will get a blank hotkey while hidden actions will be removed from
        the list. Use Add to add a removed invisible action.

      @{b}Repeat@{ub}
        This switch tells if the current hotkey should also accept key-repeat
        events. Arrow keys and such is most efficient with key-repeat while
        events such as Save should not accept a repeating event, but the
        choice is yours.


  @{u}Appearance@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Graphics@{fg text}

      @{b}Right side window border scroll bar@{ub}
        Enable a normal intuition scroll bar in the right side window border.
        Note that you need to close and reopen any windows for this setting
        to take effect.

      @{b}Filled cursor@{ub}
        Normally the cursor is unfilled until you start to select text with
        the mouse. Select this to invert this behavior, i.e. type with a
        filled cursor.

      @{b}Visible text selection@{ub}
        Before Ann v2.4 the selection of text which selecting it was not visible.
        With v2.4+ this setting exists and is default. It enables visible
        selection while making them, as more editors to it.

      @{b}Show edited lines in the scroll bar@{ub}
        This setting will make edited lines show as marks in the left side
        scroll bar to make it very easy to find your way back to a place
        you have just edited.
        The marks are reset everytime a file is saved.

    @{fg shine}Text@{fg text}

      @{b}Show Line/Col/Char in the status bar@{ub}
        Select this to make the status bar display the current line and
        column the cursor is on and also what ASCII-value the character
        under the cursor has.

      @{b}Draw linefeeds & tabs in the text@{ub}
        Select this to make Ann draw the end of lines with a '' character.
        Tabs will be drawn as a line with a small knee on unless syntax
        highlighting is enabled.

      @{b}Show locked lines as underlined@{ub}
        Select this to make Ann mark what lines have been locked from editing.

    @{fg shine}Font@{fg text}

      @{b}Use system default font@{ub}
        This is the default, to use the same font as e.g. Shell uses.

        If this is unselected it is possible to select another font
        using the font requester in the field below. Only fixed fonts
        are supported.
        Note: When trying out new fonts you cannot go back to using the
        system default font without restarting Ann.

    @{fg shine}Ed Exchange@{fg text}

      @{b}Open Ed Exchange on startup@{ub}
        Opens the project and file manager Ed Exchange on startup which
        makes it a lot easier to handle multiple opened files.


  @{u}Colors@{uu}

    Here you select what pens you like to use for the different parts
    of the editor, such as text, scroll bar, etc.


  @{u}Window@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Operation@{fg text}

      @{b}Put filename in window title@{ub}
        Shows the current filename instead of "Annotate 3.0" in the window
        title bar of each editor window.

      @{b}Smart new window placing@{ub}
        When opening Ann it will read the configuration file and see where
        to open its window and how large it should be. When opening more
        windows they will normally be put right on top of each other which
        can make it hard to flip between them. This switch makes a new
        window open slightly to the right and slightly lower than the
        previous window to make it easier to flip between them.

      @{b}New window opens relative to current@{ub}
        Select this if you would like new window to open as the current
        instead of using the default size and position.

      @{b}Silent window activation@{ub}
        Normally, whenever you click in the text editor window, the cursor
        will be placed. This is not always desired though if the window
        was inactive and you only wanted to activate the window. This
        switch makes it possibly to activate the window by clicking once
        on the text without moving the cursor.

      @{b}Remember file requester position@{ub}
        When this is enabled Ann will remember (and save when you save config)
        the position and dimension of the file requester. When this is not
        selected the requester will open at the top left of the current
        editor window.
        NOTE: The size is ignored if your ASL Prefs in AmigaOS is set to
              override the dimension of ASL requesters.

    @{fg shine}Dimensions@{fg text}

      @{b}Window left edge@{ub}, @{b}Window top edge@{ub}, @{b}Window width@{ub}, @{b}Window height:@{ub}
        The default size and position the editor window will open at.

      @{b}Get window dimensions@{ub}
        This button will read the current size and position of the window
        from which you opened this config window and put these values in
        the fields described above. Easier than to guess and type them in
        manually when editing default startup preferences.

    @{fg shine}Screens@{fg text}

      These settings lets you configure on what screen Ann should open.
      Options are Workbench, frontmost screen (which could be for example
      DirOpus) or a new public screen.

      It also has settings for background picture.

      Depending you your setting when starting more than one instance of
      Ann, it can be configured on what screen further instances should
      open on.


  @{u}Options@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Program settings@{fg text}

      @{b}Open file requester when starting from Workbench@{ub}
        This setting will make Ann open a file requester if Ann is started
        from Workbench without shift-clicking another file to edit.

      @{b}Open documents in the same instance@{ub}
        Sometimes it may be practical to have all open documents open in the
        same currently running instance of Ann to be able to share Find/Replace
        requester strings and other settings.
        Selecting this will cause any new extra started instance of Ann with one
        filename parameter to send this filename to the already running process
        to open it there instead of starting a new instance Ann. Note that it
        only works when starting Ann with one parameter, or shift-clicking on
        one other icon.

      @{b}Open new editors in the same instance@{ub}
        This is similar to the above setting, but instead of opening files in
        the one running instance it will take effect only when starting Ann
        without arguments, i.e. starting Ann will be the same as choosing
        New from the Project menu in the already running instance of Ann.

      @{b}Remember the line last visited when opening files@{ub}
        This is a useful feature that makes it easier to remember where you
        last edited a file when opening the file again. It will write the
        file ENVARC:AnnotateLastLine.xml everytime you save to record where
        in the file you last edited and use this information when the file
        is opened again later.

      @{b}Disable ARexx@{ub}
        Usually Ann opens a comprehensive ARexx port when started, but if
        more than one copy of Ann is started independently, all but the
        first will fail to open this ARexx port and will let you know
        through a requester. This switch disables the ARexx port completely.

        If you want ARexx @{u}and@{uu} be able to start multiple instances it
        is suggested to enable the above two options.

      @{b}Disable only the ARexx warning@{ub}
        Use this switch to disable the warning you see when Ann fails to open
        the ARexx port, mostly due to the fact that one copy of Ann is already
        running.

      @{b}Auto Update Annotate when a new version is available@{ub}
        When this is selected Ann will look over the Internet if a new version
        of Ann has been released. It will not look more often than every
        5 days. You will of course be asked what to do. Nothing will be
        installed without your approval.

        @{b}Check Now@{ub}
          This button will open the update window with which you can check for
          new versions, see new changes and download an update.

      @{b}Beep or flash the screen on warnings and errors@{ub}
        Makes you hear a beep or flash in the screen when you try to search
        once more after the last occurrence has been found and the search
        wraps around from the beginning (or end) again, or when a file cannot
        be saved, or when a new update is available, or when you try to undo
        or redo but the buffer is at the end.

    @{fg shine}Search and Replace@{fg text}

      @{b}Default search method:@{ub}
        The Find and Replace functions offer five ways of searching for
        text. This gadget specifies the default way.

      @{b}Default replace prompt type:@{ub}
        When replacing there are three ways of being prompted before
        replacing. This specifies the default way.


  @{u}Syntax@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Syntax Highlighting@{fg text}

      @{i}Lister @{ui}
        This lister contains all languages that have syntax highlighting loaded
        and available in Ann at the moment. The file "AnnotateSyntax.xml" contains
        the definitions of the highlighting schemes.
        See @{"Syntax" link syntax} for an explanation of how to edit this file.

      @{b}Enable syntax highlighting@{ub}
        This switch is a master switch for the whole highlightning engine.
        If it is switched off the old draw routine will be used and no colors
        or styles will be used.

        When this switch is on all files that are loaded will be attempted
        for qualification for any of the different languages defined. If no
        qualification matches the contents of the file loaded it is assumed
        it is a plain text file and will get no syntax highlightning.

      @{b}Add file@{ub}
        With this button you can easily add your own syntax file or one of
        the contribution files to your installation without editing the main
        syntax file yourself.

      @{b}Edit@{ub}
        This will open the syntax file (which is in XML format) into a new editor
        so you can edit it. (You need to exit the Config to edit.)

      @{b}Reload@{ub}
        This button reloads the syntax file "AnnotateSyntax.xml". It first tries
        to load it from current directory. If not found it will search ENVARC:.
        It can be useful to reload the syntax file when making and trying out
        a new scheme for a new language.
        Click @{b}Apply@{ub} to put the new colors on the current editor directly without
        exiting the config.


  @{u}Tools@{uu}

    Allows you to add commands for the F-keys. These command will appear in
    Ann's Tools menu.


  @{u}Load/Save@{uu}

    @{fg shine}Loading@{fg text}

      @{b}Word wrap while loading@{ub}
        If you have a textfile without line breaks or linefeeds in it, it
        can be useful to be able to have this text word wrapped when you
        load it, else it will end up on one very long line which makes it
        hard to read.

      @{b}Load with UTF-8 to Latin1 conversion@{ub}
        In case you have a text encoded in UTF-8 Latin1 you may want to
        select this before loading it to have it converted back to normal
        8-bit ASCII.

      @{b}Set tab mode and indent mode depending on if files contain tabs@{ub}
        This setting will cause the Editor settings "Tab-key inserts real tab"
        and "Auto indent with tabs" to be set automatically depending on if
        a file contains any tab characters or not when it is loaded.

      @{b}Default directory:@{ub}
        Unless Ann is started with a file as argument, this is the directory
        the file requester will default to.

    @{fg shine}Saving@{fg text}

      @{b}Save carriage return (MS-DOS)@{ub}
        Select this to make Ann save not only the Line Feed (0x0A) character
        as a line break, which is standard on Amiga and UNIX, but instead
        save the combination of Carriage Return + Line Feed (0x0D0A), which
        is standard in DOS and Windows. If you intend to read a file in
        MS Notepad you will need this.

        Note that Ann automatically flushes carriage returns in files
        when loading so even if your file had CR in it, you will need
        to enable this before saving to put them back there.

      @{b}Create icons for saved files@{ub}
        Select this if you want Ann to create icons for the files that
        are saved.

      @{b}Backup last file as #?.bak when saving@{ub}
        Select this if you want Ann to make backup files whenever a file
        is saved. The behavior of this function has changed slightly
        since v2.2 of Ann.

        Whenever you save a file there will always be two copies.
        If you save a new file it will be saved twice where one of them
        will get the extension '.bak'. If you attempt to overwrite an
        existing file, this old existing file will be renamed with the
        extension '.bak' before your file is saved. This way you will
        have access to the second latest file with the same name.

      @{b}Save when window is inactivated@{ub}
        If this is selected the editor will automatically save a
        modified file everytime you select another window so that the
        current editor window gets inactive.

        This is useful if you do many small changes in a row while using
        another application to test the result everytime, like when fixing
        compiler-errors. Then you never need to worry about saving everytime
        because the editor will do that automatically when you click in the
        shell to compile, or whatever it may be you are doing.

      @{b}Save modified editors every [X] minutes@{ub}
        This is a times auto-saving feature. Nothing strange. It will
        save all modified editors at the interval you specify.

        A note about backup files though: If saving backups is selected,
        the backup file will only be automatically written if it does
        not exist. If a backup exists it will not be overwritten by any
        of the auto-saving features!



  @{b}Apply@{ub}
    Apply and test the settings in the editor windows without closing
    the config window and with the possibility to discard the changes.

    Apply also sets editor-local settings such as @{b}Tab size@{ub} for all
    editors.

  @{b}Save@{ub}
    Closes the config window and saves the settings to ENVARC:Annotate.xml.

  @{b}Use@{ub}
    This closes the config window with the current settings and saves
    them to ENV:.

  @{b}Cancel@{ub}
    Discard the changed settings and close the config window.
    If you have applied a new font, it will not be reverted back to the
    previous font in the editor, only in the actual font selection field.
    Changed hotkeys will not be reverted either.

@node "syntax" "Syntax Highlightning"

  @{fg shine}@{b}Format of the language definition file
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

  This chapter describes the file containing the syntax highlighting
  definitions for the languages. The file is called "AnnotateSyntax.xml"
  and should be place in the current directory of a specific project
  and/or ENVARC: to be accessible from anywhere.

  The highlighting is based on @{i}tokens@{ui}. A token is a short string
  containing a special word or character(s) that should be applied a certain
  text style of color.
  Example: In the language C, "if" is a common token, as well as "(" and ";".

  The file is in XML format and there are a limited number of supported
  tags used to build the color and style codes for a language. All tags and
  their attributes are case sensitive! Here is a hierarchical summary of the
  possible tags:

  <Ann-SyntaxHighlighting> - The !DOCTYPE of the file. (This tag is ignored by Ann.)
    <SyntaxFile>           - Defines an external xml file containing one or more languages.
    <Syntax>               - Defines a new language.
      <Name>               - Name of language (max 27 characters).
      <Qualifying>         - Contains recognition rules for a language.
        <OrTokens>         - A minimum number of these tokens must be in a file.
        <AndTokens>        - All of these tokens must be in a file.
        <FilePattern>      - A file should have a name matching this pattern to be recognized.

      <Tokens>             - Number of tokens in this language.
      <Token>              - A character array (max 27 chars) assigned a style and color.
      <ComplexToken>       - A complex token typically consisting of a start and end token.
        <Token>            - Start token.
        <MatchToToken>     - End token.
        <MatchToEOL>       - If end token is not found, color will be applied to the the end of line.
        <MultiLine/>       - If end token is not found, color will be applied over the rest of the entire file.


  @{u}Short lesson in XML@{uu}

  To spare you from reading up on XML, here are some pointers useful to know:
  - XML does not define any tags by itself (like HTML do).
  - A tag starts like this: @{fg fill}<Tag>@{fg text} It ends like this: @{fg fill}</Tag>@{fg text} (just like HTML).
  - Between the start and end tags there can be almost any text data.
  - If you encounter problems, encapsulate your text like this:
    @{fg fill}<Tag><![CDATA[My difficult data containing both "<" & ">" characters]]></Tag>@{fg text}
  - A tag without any data (possibly only attributes) does not need an end tag
    but can look like this: @{fg fill}<Tag/>@{fg text} or this: @{fg fill}<Tag attr="true"/>@{fg text}
  - These characters are special and need escaping: &  <  >  "  '
    They are escaped (in order) like this: &amp;  &lt;  &gt;  &quot;  &apos;
  - Using escaped characters does not work (well) as text data between tags,
    only in attribute text.
  - Attributes are written like this: @{fg fill}<Tag attribute1="my attr1" my_num_attr="1234">@{fg text}
  - All attribute data must be in "quotes" (unlike HTML).


  @{u}How to create a syntax definition@{uu}

  There are basically two parts of an Annotate syntax definition:
  1. The qualifying part.
  2. The token part.

  The qualifying part is used by Ann when a file is loaded to be able to
  recognize which one of all syntax definitions this file should use. It does
  this by looking for specific tokens in the file. If it finds enough tokens
  according to a qualifying set that syntax definition will be used. If not,
  it continues in the list of syntax definitions.

  The token part defines which tokens should be highlighted and how. There are
  a few ways it can be done. Normally a simple keyword is highlighted somehow
  and this is done with <Token>. Other specific things like comments and strings
  cannot be directly detected but needs to be defined using a <ComplexToken>.

  Continue reading to get the details, and feel free to use the existing syntax
  file as an example. When you are pleased with the result you could drop me an
  e-mail so I could include it in the main distribution.


  @{u}Detailed explanation of Ann's tags@{uu}

  <@{b}Ann-SyntaxHighlighting@{ub}>
    This tag surrounds the whole file.

    - This tag can only exists once as a top tag.
    - Tags contained by this tag: N*<Syntax>, N*<SyntaxFile>
    - Data in this tag: Can only contain other tags.

  <@{b}SyntaxFile@{ub} filename>
    This tag specifies an external syntax file to be loaded. Use this to add
    your new syntax file to the main syntax file without having to copy and
    paste it into the main syntax file.

    This file has to follow the same specifications as described here. That
    means it has to contain some <Syntax> definition to be useful. It could
    also recursively contain another <SyntaxFile> definition but that is
    untested.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Ann-SyntaxHighlighting>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: none

    Example: <SyntaxFile filename="path/my_own_syntax.xml"/>

  <@{b}Syntax@{ub}>
    This tag contains a full definition of a language.

    Note that if you have many similar languages it may be useful to know
    that Ann will start to qualify for a matching syntax with the @{u}last@{uu}
    <Syntax> in the file. This means that you should put the least significant
    language first in the syntax file.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Ann-SyntaxHighlighting>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: 1*<Name>, 1*<Qualifying>, 1*<Tokens>, N*<Token>, N*<ComplexToken>
    - Data in this tag: Can only contain other tags.

  <@{b}Name@{ub}>
    Specifies the name of the language. A maximum of 27 characters can be used.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Syntax>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A string with a maximum length of 27 characters.

  <@{b}Qualifying@{ub}>
    Specifies a set of rules used by Ann to identify a text and/or file as a
    certain language. You need a properly tuned Qualifying set if you want Ann
    to recognize your specific file type automatically and to not incorrectly
    recognize other, similar, file types.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Syntax>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: N*<OrTokens>, 1*<AndTokens>, 1*<FilePattern>
    - Data in this tag: Can only contain other tags.

    This tag is used in a specific way: When loading a file Ann uses this
    information to try to determine if this <Syntax> should be applied to the
    file or not. The following logic will be applied when loading a file,
    except for OrTokens and AndTokens that are defined as mandatory:

    FOR ALL <Syntax> IN <SyntaxHighlighting> DO
      useThisLanguage := <OrTokens> AND <AndTokens> AND <FilePattern> == TRUE

    IF useThisLanguage == FALSE THEN
      FOR ALL <Syntax> IN <SyntaxHighlighting> DO
        useThisLanguage := <FilePattern> == TRUE

    IF useThisLanguage == TRUE THEN
      use <Syntax>
    ELSE
      use built-in plain text mode

    When qualifying a syntax by selecting @{i}Try Syntax Highlighting@{ui} from the
    menu, one extra pass is made before deciding if this language fits or not:

    IF useThisLanguage == FALSE THEN
      FOR ALL <Syntax> IN <SyntaxHighlighting> DO
        useThisLanguage := <OrTokens> AND <AndTokens> == TRUE

    Note: Remember that the qualifying is not only designed to recognize files
          that should have this syntax highlighting, but it is also designed
          to @{i}prevent@{ui} matching of files that should @{i}not@{ui} have this syntax
          highlighting. The user may load a plain text file that happen to
          contain the same tokens as in your qualifying set. This guide could
          for example match a sloppy written XML syntax qualifying since it
          contains two mandatory tokens! It could potentially also match a C
          syntax because it has many "if", "while" and "for" in it.

  <@{b}OrTokens@{ub} min>
    Specifies a number of space-terminated tokens of which >min< number of
    tokens must exist in the file. Here you can put in a number of tokens that
    your file type may have but not necessarily all at the same time.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Qualifying>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A string without a maximum length.

    Attributes:
    >min<             - A number specifying how many times any of the tokens in <OrTokens>
                        must be found in the file to qualify for a match. This attribute
                        is mandatory and must be specified.

    >caseinsensitive<
    >ignorecase<      - These attributes are synonyms, user your favourite. They
                        make the tokens match case insensitive. This is useful
                        for languages that are case insensitive, such as HTML.
                        Default is to match case sensitive.

    >mandatory<       - This special says that this OrTokens @{b}always@{ub} has to return
                        TRUE no matter what to match this file. AmigaGuide for
                        example always starts with "@@database" and XML always
                        has "<?xml" and "<!DOCTYPE" in them.
                        Try to use this for all file types it is possible to
                        make the syntax qualifying as strong as possible to
                        avoid mismatches.

    Example: <OrTokens min="10">if while for ( ) ; int void</OrTokens>
    There must exist 10 occurrences in any combination of the 8 tokens in the file
    to make this OrToken TRUE.

  <@{b}AndTokens@{ub}>
    Specifies a number of space-terminated tokens which all must exist in the file.
    Here you specify a set of tokens that @{b}always@{ub} exists in your file type.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Qualifying>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A string without a maximum length.

    Attributes:
    >caseinsensitive<
    >ignorecase<      - These attributes are synonyms, use your favourite. They
                        make the tokens match case insensitive. This is useful
                        for languages that are case insensitive, such as HTML.
                        Default is to match case sensitive.

    >mandatory<       - This special says that this AndToken @{b}always@{ub} has to return
                        TRUE no matter what to match this file. Typically use
                        for file types that always starts with some specific
                        keyword. AmigaGuide for example always starts with
                        "@@database" and XML always has "<?xml" and "<!DOCTYPE"
                        in them.
                        Try to use this for all file types it is possible to
                        make the syntax qualifying as strong as possible to
                        avoid mismatches.

    Example: <AndTokens>{ } ; int</AndTokens>
    All these four tokens must exist in the file to make this AndToken TRUE.

    Example: <AndTokens mandatory="1">@database</AndTokens>
    The file must contain the word "@database" or the syntax can never be loaded.

  <@{b}FilePattern@{ub}>
    Specifies a file pattern that the loaded file must match.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Qualifying>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A string without a maximum length.

    Example: <FilePattern>#?.(c|h|cpp|hpp)</FilePattern>
    Match all C and C++ files.

  <@{b}Tokens@{ub}>
    Specifies the maximum number of tokens this <Syntax> has. It must be placed
    before the first <Token> or <ComplexToken>. It is used to pre-allocate
    memory for all tokens. If you have less than a third as many tokens compared
    to this number you will get a warning.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Syntax>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A number.

    Example: <Tokens>30</Tokens>
    This <Syntax> can have a maximum of 30 tokens.

  <@{b}Token@{ub} pen bgpen style absolute>
    This tag is used to specify an actual token. What style and color the
    token shall have is specified through attributes. No attribute is mandatory.
    Specifying a token without any attribute is a way to force a token into
    having normal color and style.

    - This tag can exist inside <Syntax> and <ComplexToken>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A maximum of 27 characters.

    When this tag is used alone in <Syntax> pieces of the text matching the
    string defined here will be applied the color and style specified. It
    will however do a little more than just search each line for the token.
    If a token is for example the word "for" you generally do not want it to
    match the first part of the word "@{u}for@{uu}ever" or the middle part of the word
    "there@{u}for@{uu}e". This is why Ann makes a check and fails to match this token
    if the first character in the token and the character just before the
    token in the text are both letters, underscore or digits. It also checks
    the last character in the token and the character following it in the
    text by the same criteria.
    If the >absolute< attribute is used these checks are not performed and
    if the string is found it will always match and set the color and style.

    When this tag is used in a <ComplexToken> it generally represents the
    start token where matching should begin. It can be used without any
    token string when used in a <ComplexToken> of a >type<, such as "decnumber",
    just to set the color and style of e.g. a matched decimal number.

    Attributes:
    >pen<       - A system pen number between 0 and 255 to be used as text
                  color for this token. Enter Ann's Config, go to Appearance,
                  click on a color in the palette and hold you mouse pointer
                  still for a while to see the pen number. Default is 1 (black).
                  Don't forget to click Cancel when done!

    >bgpen<     - A system pen number between 0 and 255 to be used as text
                  background color for this token. Default is 0 (grey).

    >style<     - A softstyle to be used for this token. Possible values
                  (including synonyms) are "bold", "italic", "underline",
                  "underlined". "italics",This attribute can be specified
                  many times if more than one style is desired.
                  Default is normal.

    >absolute<  - This is a bool used to suppress the extra criteria checks
                  used to see if a word is isolated or part of another word.
                  Set to anything, e.g. "1", will make it true and cause any
                  findings of the string to be a match.

    >caseinsensitive<
    >ignorecase<      - These attributes are synonyms, use your favourite. They
                        make the tokens match case insensitive. This is useful
                        for languages that are case insensitive, such as HTML.
                        Default is to match case sensitive.

    Example: <Token pen="2" bgpen="1" style="bold">int</Token>
    A part of a text parsed with this token will look like the following.
    Note: Unmatched occurrences of "int" will be underlined so you can see
          what would also be matched if the >absolute< attribute was used.

    "An @{u}int@{uu}eger, abbreviated as @{fg shine}@{bg text}@{b}int@{ub}@{bg back}@{fg text}, can be just as sweet as a m@{u}int@{uu} pastill
     and will in programming often be seen as @{fg shine}@{bg text}@{b}int@{ub}@{bg back}@{fg text}*, (@{fg shine}@{bg text}@{b}int@{ub}@{bg back}@{fg text}) or like INT."

    Note2: If one of the >caseinsensitive< or >ignorecase< attributes were
           specified, the uppercase "INT" would also be matched.

  <@{b}ComplexToken@{ub} type>
    A complex token is typically used to match something between two tokens,
    such as text between "quotes", text between /*comment delimiters*/, or
    general kinds of tokens such as #preprocessing directives that begin
    with a special character and continues with letters.

    - This tag can only exist inside <Syntax>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: 1*<Token>, 1*<MatchToToken>, 1*<MatchToEOL>, 1*<MultiLine>
    - Data in this tag: Can only contain other tags.

    Attribute:
    >type<  - If >type< is omitted, a normal token-based <ComplexToken> will be
              used where <Token> and possibly also <MatchToToken> are used.
              But if >type< is used it must be one of the following and <Token>
              or <MatchToToken> do not need to be used, but they can be. Only
              one >type< can be use per <ComplexToken>.
      "decnumber"
        Matches a decimal number, i.e. the characters 0-9. The number must be
        isolated which means that "foo@{u}1234@{uu}_bar" will not match what
        is underlined. "(@{u}1234@{uu}," will however match what is underlined.

      "hexnumber"
        Matches a hexadecimal number, i.e. the characters 0-9A-Fa-f. The number
        must be isolated which means that "_@{u}12ef@{uu}abc" will not match what is
        underlined. Use <Token>0x</Token> or <Token>$</Token> to use as prefix
        to be able to match a complete hexadecimal number in C, E or asm.

      "binnumber"
        Matches a binary number, i.e. the character 0-1. The number must
        be isolated which means that "@{u}0101@{uu}23" will not match what
        is underlined.

      "alpha"
        Matches (English) letter and underscore, i.e. the characters A-Za-z_.
        The word must be isolated which means that "023@{u}word@{uu}" will not match
        what is underlined. This type combined with <Token>#</Token> is
        useful for matching preprocessor directives in for example C and E.

      "alphaupper"
      "alphalower"
        Case sensitive versions of "alpha".

      "alphanum"
        Matches all letters, digits and underscore, i.e. the characters 0-9A-Za-z_.
        Isolation is implied with this type as there are no other given characters
        that could be confused with these characters.

      "alphanumupper"
      "alphanumlower"
        Case sensitive versions of "alphanum".

      "unprintable"
        Matches all unprintable characters, i.e. ASCII values between 0-31 and
        128-159. This includes tab (9) and linefeed (10).

    It is always the <Token> that defines the color and style.

    If you plan on using only a >type< without a <Token> but still want to put
    some color and style on your type (which is the whole point) you need to
    specify an empty <Token>. You can do that this way without an end tag:
    <Token pen="3" style="bold"/>

    Example: Put color 4 on Amiga Guide commands. Will match e.g. "\@{fg shine}".
      <ComplexToken>
        <Token pen="4">\@{</Token>
        <MatchToToken>}</MatchToToken>
      </ComplexToken>

    Example: Display hex numbers in bold.
      <ComplexToken type="hexnumber">
        <Token style="bold">0x</Token>
      </ComplexToken>

    Example: Make one-line E-comments italic.
      <ComplexToken>
        <Token style="italics">-></Token>
        <MatchToEOL/>
      </ComplexToken>

  <@{b}MatchToToken@{ub}>
    Used as an end token in <ComplexToken>. To make use of this tag the
    <ComplexToken> must use a >type< and/or a normal <Token> as well.
    Otherwise it works as <Token> except it does not support any attributes.

    - This tag can only exist inside <ComplexToken>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: A maximum of 27 characters.

    Example, see <ComplexToken>.

  <@{b}MatchToEOL@{ub}>
    This is a bool telling a <ComplexToken> to put its color and style all
    the way to the end of the line (EOL) if the <MatchToToken> is not found
    or not used.

    - This tag can only exist inside <ComplexToken>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: no data

    This tag is typically used in two cases; either to cause the start of a
    "quoted string" to match all the way to the right, or to make one-line
    comments be colored from their start to the end of the line.

    Example: <MatchToEOL/>

  <@{b}MultiLine@{ub}>
    This is a special bool telling a <ComplexToken> to put its color and style
    all the way to <MatchToToken> even if it is not on the same line. This
    means that if <MatchToToken> is not found the entire file will be searched
    and colored from the <Token> and forward.

    - This tag can only exist inside <ComplexToken>.
    - Tags contained by this tag: none
    - Data in this tag: no data

    This tag is typically used for multi-line comments, such as /* */ in C
    and E.

    Example: <MultiLine/>

Annotate uses standard Amiga menus with one exception. All hotkeys are
case sensitive. For example:

       Menu Item                Quick Key           You Press
       
      "Open ..."                 Amiga-o            Amiga-o
      "Open New..."              Amiga-O            Amiga-Shift-o

The following is a list of all Ann menu items with a brief description for 
each one.
     
  @{" Project " link project_menu} @{" Edit " link edit_menu} @{" Formatting " link format_menu} @{" Search " link search_menu} @{" Navigation " link nav_menu} @{" Window " link window_menu} @{" Macros " link mac_menu} @{" Settings " link setting_menu} @{" Tools " link tool_menu}

     New
       This will create a new document in a new window.

     Open...
       This will bring up an ASL requester for opening files and will
       open the first selected file in the current window replacing
       the current editor. New windows will be opened for the rest of
       the files.

     Open New...
       This will bring up an ASL requester for opening files and
       will open all selected files in new windows.

     Hide and Open New...
       Opens a new file in the current window and puts the already opened
       file in the list of hidden editor that you can find from Ed Exchange.

     Save
       This just saves the file. It will prompt for a name and behave like
       "Save As" if this it is a new unnamed document.

     Save As...
       Lets you save the file as a different name.

     Save All Modified
       This saves every file that has been modified.

     Save / Close
       This saves the file. It will prompt for a name and behave like
       "Save As" if this it is a new unnamed document. The editor and
       possibly also the window will then be closed.

     Save All / Quit
       This option saves all current documents and quits the program.


     Project >

       Open...
         Open a previously saved Annotate project file in XML
         format, ending with ".apx". This will automatically
         open all files specified in the project and adjust
         their editor windows as they were when the project
         was saved.

       Save...
         This will save the current state of all opened files
         and windows so they can all be opened as they were at
         a later time. Very practical if you usually switch off
         your Amiga between programming sessions for example, or
         when testing something that crashes a lot.

       Close
         Close a project. This can be done in two ways:
         1. Close all files and editors associated with the
            project. If all editors are part of the project then
            Ann will quit.
         2. Close only the logical project itself and leave all files
            and editors untouched, just disconnect them from the
            project. Useful to "reset" the project to be able to
            add new files to it.

     Print
       Sends the current window out to PRT: for text printing.

     Close
       Close the current window and ask to save if modified.

     About...
       This item merely give some information on this version of
       Annotate and a brief description.

     Quit
       This option lets the user quit without saving the documents.
       If changes have been made, a requester will pop up asking if
       you wish to really quit.

  ~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

     Cut >
       This will allow you to "cut" text which copies the selected text
       to the selected clipboard and deletes it from the editor.

       There are 6 clipboard "units" available in Ann. Unit 0 is the
       normal clipboard unit used the the system and most other program.
       By having access to more than one clipboard unit you can cut and
       copy more than one piece of text at the time. Very practical.

     Copy >
       This will allow you to "copy" text which copies the selected text
       to the selected clipboard and.

     Paste >
       This will allow you to "paste" text which inserts the text in the
       selected clipboard into the editor where the cursor is positioned.

       There is a setting that enables pasting of text to replace a
       selected part in the editor. Most editor default to replace selected
       text when pasting, but Ann does not default to do that since it uses
       so called sticky selection.

     Begin Select
       Start a selection from the keyboard. This feature is  mostly here
       for making selections from ARexx and Macros.

     End Sel
       End a selection from the keyboard. This feature is mostly here
       for making selections from ARexx and Macros.

     Select >

       Word or Token
         Selects the word, phrase or token the cursor is on.
         If the cursor is on any bracket like {[()]} it will try to find
         a matching mark and select all text between them including the
         brackets.
         If the cursor is on an @-sign it will try to match a complete
         e-mail address.
         There is more logic as well. Just try it out.

       Line
         Selects entire line the cursor is on.

       All
         Simply selects the entire document.

       None
         Simply unselect a marked piece of text. Same as clicking with
         your mouse on the cursor. The point of this menu entry is to
         connect a hotkey to it so you can unselect using your keyboard
         since Ann uses sticky selection.

     Line >

       Duplicate
         This will take the line the current cursor is on and duplicate
         it on the next line.

       Merge
         Merge line takes the current line the cursor is on and tacks
         the next line to the end of it. The same as putting the
         cursor at the end of a line and hit the Delete key, but it
         also removes all while spaces from the next line.

       Delete
         This menu item deletes the line the cursor is on.

     Erase
       This will delete the current selection.

     Insert ASCII Code
       Opens a requester that lets you input a number between 0 and 255.
       This number is inserted at cursor position when the OK gadget is
       pressed. Useful if you need to insert a character that is
       impossible to type on the keyboard.

     Lock Lines
       Sets all lines in the current selection to locked. This 
       makes the selected lines uneditable. You can use this 
       feature to protect certain parts of your document. Locked 
       lines will appear underlined if you have the "Show locked
       lines as underlined" gadget ticked in the config.

     Unlock Lines
       Sets all locked lines in the current selection to unlocked.

     Undo
       Reverts the last change. Note that it will undo the change of
       a whole line, not every single character typed or deleted.
       You can undo any number of times you like, unless memory
       runs out.

     Redo
       Undo what has been undone. If you undo and change your mind,
       you can redo any number or times to get back your latest
       changes. But after you make a new change the old redo timeline
       gets erased and you cannot redo anymore until you make another
       Undo because the editor cannot maintain multiple timelines.

     Last Saved
       This will "revert" the text to the last version saved.

         Left will push the line the cursor is on to the far left.

       Centered
         Centers the line between the left and the Word wrap column.

       Right
         Pushes the line up so it touches the Word wrap column.

       This will shift all of the characters in the current selection right.

     Wrap Text
       Will immediately try to word wrap all lines longer that the
       word wrap column specified in the config. If there is some
       text selected it will only wrap lines inside the selection.
       Otherwise the whole file will be wrapped.

     Lower Case
       This will shift all of the characters in the current

@node "search_menu" "Search Menu"

  @{fg shine}@{b}Search Menu
  ~~~~~~~~~~~@{ub}@{fg text}

     Find...
       Opens a requester used for searching the text.  The string gadget
       accepts a string of characters to search for, or a DOS pattern to
       match against whole lines of text.

       The Search Method specifies how to search. There are five ways
       to search:
       "Case Sensitive" - Searches for the exact thing you have entered.
       "Non-Case Sensitive" - Ignores the difference between UPPER/lower
       case characters.
       "Whole Words, Case Sensitive" - Very useful to find specific
       words or numbers. If you for example need to find a variable
       named 'str' this function will not stop on text like 'string',
       'strcmp', 'Astrid', only where 'str' is separated by non-alphabetic
       and non-digit characters, such as 'str=' or 'func(str,'.
       "Whole Words, Non-Case Sensitive" - Same as the above but case
       insensitive.
       "Wild Cards" - Uses dos/MatchPattern to find any line. Use the
       same kind of pattern as you would in a shell. Ex: 'param#?45'

       "Search from the beginning" will cause find to start from the
       beginning instead of the cursor position.
       "Search backwards" will search upwards in the text starting
       from the cursor.
       "Live searching" - Searches while you type. This makes is a lot easier
       to find something you are not sure how it is spelled.

     Find Next
       Uses the string from the original find requester to find
       the next instance of the string.

     Find Previous
       Uses the string from the original find requester to find
       the previous instance of the string.

     Replace...
       Opens a replace requester that allows you to replace text.
       The string gadgets accepts strings to search for and replace
       with.  There are cycle type gadgets from search type and
       prompt type.
       See the description of Search Method for the Find function.

       Prompt type chooses how to alert you before making a change.
       "Replace All" causes all text to be replace at once.
       "Prompt before start" will find the first occurrence and then
       ask you once.
       "Always ask" will ask you for every occurrence.

       "Replace from the beginning" will cause the replacing to
       start from the beginning instead of the cursor position.
       "Replace backwards" will replace upwards in the text starting
       from the cursor.

     Find Selection
       Takes the current selection and places it in the find
       requester of Find or Replace.

     Replace with Selection
       Takes the current selection and places it in the replace
       part of the replace requester.

     Find Previous Change
       Jumps to the previous change in the file.

     Find Next Change
       Jumps to the next change in the file.

     Match Brace
       This finds the opposite bracket or brace and takes the
       cursor to it if there is a match.

     Store Position >
       Stores a cursor position as a scrollstore position.
       Useful when editing different places in the same file and like
       to easily find you way back. A scroll store is visible in the
       left side scrollbar as well.

     Get Cursor to View
       Puts the cursor in the middle of the window if not already in
       view. It is the counterpart of "Goto Cursor".

     Fold
       This will fold the currently selected lines into one line.
       Useful if you have a long text but have a big part of it already
       finished. Then you can fold this part of the text into one line
       to make it easier to scroll around in the rest of the text.

     Unfold
       This will unfold the folded line the cursor is currently on.

       editors.

       It allows you to swap files using only one or a few windows,
       or you can use it to easily find and activate an editor window.
       Just try it.

       Note: There is unfortunately no more docs on Ed Exchange at the

       Play macro is used to play macros 1 to 10 depending on 
       the number you select. Note that the Quick key is Shift +
       the function key which corresponds to the macro you wish 
       to play. Also if you hold down the Ctrl key in the quick 
       key combination the macro will shut down screen update 
       until after the macro has finished. For macros that do a 
       lot of screen update this can speed up the macro 
       dramatically.

     Try Syntax Highlighting
       This menu operation is useful if you are editing a new file
       and, after writing a bit, would like to get automatic syntax
       highlighting in the editor.
       It can also work if you are editing a file that does not have
       the correct file extension since this option will ignore the
       extension.

     No syntax in this editor
       Sometimes Ann makes the wrong decision about what language a
       file is in and applies the wrong highlighting. Use this
       option to clear syntax highlighting from this editor.

       Alternatively you can open the Config and manually select a
       highlighting you prefer.

     Rectangular Selection
       The selection will change from a line selection to a vertical
       or rectangular selection. To find out what mode the window is in,
       look at the status bar it will have an "LS" or "VS" in it,
       meaning Line Select mode or Vertical Select mode respectively.

       This mode is extremely useful when editing matrices or tables
       of data, and also repetitive sections of programming code or
       log files. You need to get used to this mode if you are not
       already.

       Side-shifting of text left and right also works a bit special
       in this mode an allows you you very easily move a column of
       text apart or together.

       Example in C code: You have a prefilled array like this:
struct Test array[] = {10,"foo",
                       20,"hello",
                       30,"there",
                       40,"have",
                       50,"you",
                       60,"mastered",
                       70,"rectangles",
                       80,"yet?",
                       90,":-)"};

       Then you realize the you want to insert once element like this:
struct Test array[] = {10,"foo",
                       20,"hello",
                       30,"there",
                       30,"dude", // Notice there are two number 30 now. What to do??
                       40,"have",
                       50,"you",
                       60,"mastered",
                       70,"rectangles",
                       80,"yet?",
                       90,":-)"};

       Use a rectangular selection like this:
struct Test array[] = {10,"foo",
                       20,"hello",
                       30,"there",
                       @{bg fill}30@{bg background},"dude",
                       @{bg fill}40@{bg background},"have",
                       @{bg fill}50@{bg background},"you",
                       @{bg fill}60@{bg background},"mastered",
                       @{bg fill}70@{bg background},"rectangles",
                       @{bg fill}80@{bg background},"yet?",
                       @{bg fill}90@{bg background},":-)"};

       Now just cut this column of text out, remove the other '30' and
       paste it one line up and insert '100' for the last item. Done!
       Now consider this with a table several hundred lines long and
       with much more data. You can save A LOT of time learning to use this.

     Numpad Scrolls
       Sets the keypad between scroll movement and typing numbers.
       Much like a "NumLock" key on a PC.

     Execute Rexx Script...
       After selecting this item a file requester will appear 
       with '#?.rexx' in the pattern gadget. When you select a 
       file Ann will run it as 'rx filename'. Note; this will 
       only work if you have ARexx properly installed on your 
       system. This has nothing to do with the built-in arexx
       port of Ann.

     Repeat Next Event...
       Will produce a number requester. Whatever number you put into the
       requester will be the number of times the next event is repeated.

       For example, if you input the number 10 into the requester and
       after hitting OK you press the letter 'A', the editor will
       automatically insert ten A's into the text.
       Mostly useful when playing macros. For example record a macro and
       play it 100 times.

     User Tools
       After this menu item, are the tools that may be added by you.

The following are a list of base commands for the Annotate ARexx port 
which can be addressed as:
     
     address('Annotate_Rexx')
     
Each of these base commands may have more specific commands and/or 
parameters follow them. For example the if you wish to play macro 6 via
the rexx port the command would be:

     DOMENU PLAY_MACRO 6

In this case DOMENU is the base command, PLAY_MACRO is the first sub 
command, and 6 is the second sub command. Note that menu commands never 
take any parameters.

An example of a command that does take parameters is:

     MOVE_CURSOR REL 5 8

Where MOVE_CURSOR is the base command, REL (for relative to the current
position of the cursor) is the sub command and 5 and 8 are the parameters 
for deltaX and deltaY. This command will move the cursor 5 spaces to the 
right and 8 spaces down exactly the same way you can do with the cursor keys.

If OPTIONS RESULTS has been specified in the rexx program then many of the 
following commands will also return valuable information.

The following is a complete list of Annotates rexx commands, subcommands, 
parameters and return values.

The list may also be obtain directly from Ann using this CLI command line:

@node "DOMENU" 

The DOMENU ARexx command can be used to access most menu items by simply 
writing out the menu item after DOMENU. Menu items with more then one 
word in them such as "Last Saved" must be written as "LAST_SAVED" so Ann 
will not think the word "SAVED" is another subcommand. DOMENU commands 
never take any params and never return anything. Below is a complete list 
of the menu items supported be Ann. Indented items are sub commands of the 
previous item and must be used to make the command work.

Example how to past the text in clipboard unit 0:
DOMENU PASTE 0

Note that commands that has three dots (...) in them will require user
interaction beyond the control of an arexx script.

   We in OnyxSoft have been releasing freeware applications for over 10 years
   and still going strong with the fullest ambition for the Amiga platform.

   All our titles are totally free of charge without any crippled functions etc.
  
   We have now established a paypal-account after many users have asked us
   how to donate money to us (for motivating us even further and keeping the
   software releases "flowing").
  
   To send us donations, please use the following email: @{b}donate@onyxsoft.se@{ub}
